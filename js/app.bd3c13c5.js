As far back as any can remember in the world of Deskar, a child's 10th birthday has always been marked by a vivid dream. The specifics vary from person to person, but universally several young spirits are encountered in the dreamscape and, when the child awakes, one is bound to them forevermore. From that day forward the spirit and child are constant companions, lending each other their strength to overcome any feature in their path.\n&nbsp;\nIn general, a spiritbound and their spirit share a body, living in peaceful harmony. However, when either party wishes it, the spirit can assume a diminutive physical form, the appearance of which varies. This is often a side-effect of a spiritbound making use of their powers, although many simply summon their spirit for the company. In times of great danger spirits have been known to *awaken*, an experience where they assume a larger, more powerful form, often at great expense to both the spiritbound and the spirit itself.\n&nbsp;\nThere are six common types of spirits within Deskar, all with their own selection of powers to choose from. A spiritbound can only ever be bound to a singular spirit, so choose wisely!\n&nbsp;\n<img :src=\"$jenna\" v-bind:class=\"mobileOrNormal('earth-circle')\" />\n- **Earth Spirits** are associated with strength, stability, and courage. Earth spirits can manipulate earth and stone, greatly enhance their physical strength, inspire courage in others, and read the subtle motions of the earth to 'see' at great distances. Earth spirits tend to take forms reminiscent of great beasts of burden that are renowned for their strength as well as animals that burrow. They tend to be a bit slower to act when compared with other spirits but are nearly impossible to stop when they decide on a course of action.\n- **Flame Spirits** are associated with power, volatility, and rage. Manipulation of fire and heat are the most common powers displayed by Flame spirits, but they also are capable of greatly enhancing their spiritbound's physical performance, albeit with painful repercussions, fan the flames of rage in themselves and others, and even catch brief glimpses of the future in flames. Flame spirits nearly exclusively take the form of predatory animals, especially ones known for hunting in a pack. Flame spirits are commonly regarded as dangerous to interact with as they are easily offended and quick to take revenge, but those that have dealt with them know that they are just as fiercely loyal to their friends.\n- **Metal Spirits** are associated with Stamina, progress, and determination. Of all the elements, metal is the most resistant to change but, despite this, Metalbound are able to magnetically control it, enhance its strength and other properties as well as channel it inwards for impossible Stamina, use it to dampen the senses of foes, or send a crushing wave of despair outward. Metal spirits tend to be smaller in stature than the other elements, and commonly take the form of insects and other armored creatures. Metal Spirits have only become somewhat common since the Sundering, and in this time mankind has found them to be a stalwart ally, if a bit alien in nature compared to the other spirits.\n- **Water Spirits** are associated with fluidity, peace, and adaptability. Water spirits can control water and ice as if it was an extension of their own form, but are also able to exert limited control over the blood of living things, primarily for healing purposes, create an aura of calm, and see into the past to a limited degree. These spirits often take the form of aquatic and amphibious creatures, although it is common for a Water spirit to not have a truly defined form. Water spirits are known for being slow to anger, but also for their long memories. In this new age, people have found river spirits to be one of their most consistent allies, although they bring swift retaliation if disrespected.\n- **Wind Spirits** are associated with freedom, change, and speed. These spirits can conjure powerful winds and sudden lightning storms, but can also enhance the speed and reactions of their spiritbound, invoke a deep, primal fear in foes, and feel the movement of the wind for unparalleled awareness. Wind spirits commonly take the form of creatures capable of flight or those known for their speed but, like Water spirits, tend to be a bit more ephemeral in form. Wind spirits are unpredictable by nature and it takes a clever and wise spiritbound to deal with them. Despite their unpredictability, they are rarely truly malicious except in the most extreme of circumstances.\n- **Wood Spirits** are associated with the wilderness, tradition, and growth. Wood spirits are able to control their namesake, but can also urge plants to grow, transfer life between living things, create powerful feelings of joy, and sense the emotions of those near them. Wood spirits commonly take small mammalian forms, with a preference for vaguely humanoid ones. Wood spirits are commonly regarded as mischievous and often play pranks, even upon their spiritbound. These pranks range from harmless to potentially lethal, causing most to approach wood spirits with an air of caution.\n"},992:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Earth.a983968f.svg"},1047:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Chain.3632a261.svg"},1055:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Enraged.7a5faa81.svg"},1063:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Trinket.28d24b00.svg"},1079:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Sling.85422b23.svg"},1132:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Restrained.187d4371.svg"},1202:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Slide.40860058.svg"},1208:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Poisoned.d31d903a.svg"},1231:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Natural.80a0415a.svg"},1267:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Hobbled.3d33e6af.svg"},1334:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,{A:function(){return b}});var n=function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;e._self._setupProxy;return t("div",{staticStyle:{padding:"1em"}},[t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingDisciplines}}),t("div",{class:e.skillBox},[t("stance-card",{attrs:{stance:e.$store.getters.getStance("Example Stance")}})],1),t("br"),t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingStances}}),t("br"),t("div",{class:e.skillBox},[t("tech-card",{attrs:{tech:e.$store.getters.getTechnique("Example Technique")}})],1),t("br"),t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingTechniques}}),t("div",{class:e.skillBox},[t("chart-table",{staticStyle:{"font-size":"smaller"},attrs:{chart:e.$store.getters.getTechnique("Example Technique").Chart}})],1),t("br"),t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingAttackProfiles}}),t("div",{class:e.skillBox},[t("maneuver-card",{staticStyle:{"font-size":"smaller"},attrs:{maneuver:e.$store.getters.getManeuver("Example Maneuver")}})],1),t("br"),t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingManeuvers}})],1)},r=[],i=a(2893),s="\n A Profile is what is used to determine the effectiveness of an attack. It is comprised of two or three columns: _Hit_,  Damage, and Status.\n* **Hit** shows whether an Attack is a _Miss_,  _Graze_,  _Hit_,  or _Crit_. This column will always show 2-12, with a color code to show the effectiveness. When you Attack, simply consult the _Hit_ column and resolve the Attack using that row.\n    * Red means a _Miss_ which, in general, means that no effect happens with the attack.\n    * Yellow means a _Graze_, which is typically a minor effect that rarely inflicts Status.\n    * Green means a _Hit_, representing a solid hit, which deals a good amount of damage and typically inflicts Status.\n    * Purple means a _Crit_, representing a very effective hit. These tend to deal a great deal of damage and almost always inflict Status. \n* **Damage** shows how much damage is dealt by the attack. This is present for all Strikes and some Maneuvers.\n* **Status** shows what status conditions this attack may afflict. These will always follow the format Condition X (Y Block). The Condition is the actual status effect being afflicted, such as Hobbled. X is present if this Technique afflicts a Condition, and designates the size of the Token. Sometimes this will be followed by a x2 or x3, indicating that it applies multiple Tokens of that size. Finally, the Y Block section designates what must be paid to Negate this status effect. When this Technique is used, the Target may pay Y of the listed Block to not gain the status effect. Some Techniques will have effects that say +(Defensive Token). In these cases, the attacker gains the Token, not the defender.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Reading Maneuvers",o="### Reading Disciplines\nDisciplines are where much of a characters combat abilities come from and are how characters gain access to Stances, Techniques, and Maneuvers.\n&nbsp;\nDisciplines are separated into several Tiers. A character may only take a higher Tier of a Discipline if they have the previous Tier, and may not select Tier III Disciplines until [not Level 1].\n&nbsp;\nDisciplines are labeled with a role that generally describes the types of abilities provided. The first listed role is typically a common thread throughout most Techniques and Maneuvers and is the main purpose of the Stance, while the second role may only appear in some. The different roles are as follows:\n\n* **Artillery** Disciplines specialize in long-range and prefer to keep their distance from foes. Artillery Disciplines are typically capable of high damage at long ranges but can struggle with Cover and other obstructions.\n* **Controller** Disciplines specialize in applying status afflictions to foes and moving them about the battlefield, limiting their effectiveness and making foes easier targets for allies.\n* **Courier** Disciplines tend to have high movement among their abilities, as well as movement options that make it far easier to navigate terrain and enemy positions.\n* **Defender** Disciplines specialize in drawing fire from enemies and keeping them nearby, controlling enemies by limiting their targeting options.\n* **Shaper** Disciplines heavily manipulate Terrain and Features, either by creating them or removing them and can easily change the layout of the battlefield.\n* **Striker** Disciplines specialize in close-range combat, and often prioritize melee attacks over all else. Striker Disciplines are typically capable of the greatest damage in the system.\n* **Supporter** Disciplines are often able to provide allies with Defensive Tokens or Momentum, as well as repositioning them, removing harmful effects, or otherwise assisting allies.\n* **Survivor** Disciplines tend to provide powerful Resists that allow characters to mitigate damage and other effects to remain in the battle longer.\n\n&nbsp;\nWhen selecting Disciplines, be mindful of any common prerequisites among their Techniques; if you select a Discipline that requires a Bladed Weapon and aren't carrying one, it isn't going to be of much use! Additionally, if you intend to heavily focus on Defender Disciplines, selecting some Survivor Disciplines will be essential to keeping yourself in the battle.\n&nbsp;\n### Reading Stances",l="**Maneuvers** are ways that creatures can improve a Technique and increase its power. There are several types of **Maneuvers**, which are categorized based on how often they can be used and the common triggers for that Maneuver.\n\n&nbsp;\n* **Stratagems** are Maneuvers that characters use when they play a Technique. These Maneuvers typically enhance the power of a Technique while manipulating its Speed in some way. Characters may apply as many Stratagems as they wish to a single Technique.\n* **Blockts** are Maneuvers that characters can use on their own Turn. A character may use as many Blocktsas they wish in a given Turn but may only use a given Blockt once unless it has the _Repeatable_ keyword.\n* **Resists** are Maneuvers used in response to being assaulted in some way, typically by dodging, blocking, or countering. Characters may only use a single Resist per Turn.\n* **Reactions** are Maneuvers used in response to a specific trigger. They can be used at any point, but only once in response to a specific trigger.\n* **Gambits** are specialized ways to enhance an Attack that may be applied when the Attack is made. Any number of Gambits may be applied to a specific Attack, but only one with the _Edge_ keyword.\n* **Flourishes** are Maneuvers used at the completion of an Attack. Only one Flourish may be used each Turn.\n* **Punishes** are specialized Maneuvers used in response to a specific trigger such as a foe moving. A character may use only a single Punish each Turn.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe header of a Maneuver will simply contain its name, a brief description, and any applicable Keywords that the Reaction has. One particular keyword of note is _Flexible_; typically, Maneuvers must be applied at the same time that a Technique is played. For _Flexible_ Techniques, the Maneuver may be applied when the Technique is used.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe remainder of the Maneuver is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Reaction; they are simply here for a comprehensive definition.\n* **Cost** is what must be paid when a Maneuver is used. If the cost cannot be paid, the Maneuver may not be used.\n* **Trigger** defines what must occur to use a Maneuver. Common examples are 'You are attacked' or 'A _Phase_ begins.'\n* **Requirements** are any condition that must be true to use a Maneuver. Typically, this just requires that you are in a particular _Stance_.\n* **Weapon** is a somewhat specialized requirement; if this Maneuver references _Weapon Attacks_ they must be made using the Weapon type specified by this field.\n* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Maneuver.\n* **Special** is the secondary effect of the Maneuver, that is typically either conditional or more specific than the primary effect.\n* **Enhance** is an additional Cost that can be paid when the Technique this Maneuver has been applied to is used. This additional cost is purely optional, but can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of an Maneuver.\n",c="**Stances** represent a character's bearing in combat and tend to allow them to specialize in a specific approach in combat. A character may have one Martial Stance and one Spirit Stance active at the same time. Stances provide an easy way for character to gain combat resources, and tend to empower a specific type of action or playstyle.\n&nbsp;\nThe header of a Stance is fairly sparse; it will only contain the name of the Stance and a brief description of how it functions.\n&nbsp;\nThe meat of a Stance is contained in its body. The following fields can be typically found in a Stance:\n* **Requirements:** Most Martial Stances have this field. If a Stance has Requirements, you do not get any benefits from this Stance unless you fulfill them. You can still be using the Stance, but will not get any bonuses or resources from it. For example, if a Stance requires _Wielding_ a Bladed Weapon, if the character is _Disarmed_ of their _Bladed_ Weapon they lose all bonuses provided by said Stance.\n* **respite:** This field is present on most Stances, and indicates a way that combat resources can be easily obtained. Typically, the respite field will contain a condition that, if fulfilled, will provide the spiritbound with Momentum or some other combat resource.\n* **Refresh:** While the respite field indicates a resource that must be earned, the Refresh field indicates what combat resources a character simply gains for free at the Refresh Phase in combat. These tend to be defensive resources such as Tough and Reflex, but can occasionally include other resources or actions, such as creating Terrain during Refresh.\n* **Effect:** This field indicates a passive bonus or additional options available to the character while in this Stance. Reduced Cost or increased effectiveness for certain actions are common, but some Stances have more esoteric bonuses.\n* **Special:** This field is similar to Effect, but is usually a secondary bonus or one that breaks a typical rule.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Reading Techniques",u='**Techniques** are every attack, move, and defensive action characters take on their _Turn_ in combat. In aggregate, Techniques represent your character\'s combat capabilities.\n&nbsp;\nThe header of a Technique card contains a great deal of information. First is the name of the Technique, followed by a brief description.\n&nbsp;\nThe next line has the <ins>Speed</ins> of the Technique, which will either correspond with a Phase (such as Instinctive or 1-6) or be listed as a Reaction. This is followed by the <ins>Range</ins> of a Technique, which will be Melee (meaning it can only target adjacent foes), Self (meaning it targets the creature using it), or be listed as a numeric value. If the Technique effects an <ins>Area</ins> that is listed next (see the Areas page for more information about the different areas of effect). Finally, the <ins>AP</ins> of the Technique is listed, which is how many Action Points it takes to use. This is typically a value between 1 and 3. If no AP cost is listed, it has no cost and may be used for free.\n&nbsp;\nFollowing that, all Keywords for the Technique are listed. These can be flags such as _Glancing_ that make the Technique less effective, or something like _Pierce_, which makes it far easier to deal with _Block_.\n&nbsp;\nBetween the body and the header of a Technique there is a colored line that designates the <ins>Type</ins> of the action.\n* **<span style="color: darkblue">General:</span>** A <ins>General</ins> Technique is designated by a blue background and the <img :src="$general" style="height:1em" /> symbol. General Techniques tend to target yourself or the environment, or impact foes in a non-damaging way.\n* **<span style="color: darkred">Strike:</span>** A <ins>Strike</ins> Technique is designated by a red background and the <img :src="$strike" style="height:1em" /> symbol. Strike Techniques typically deal high damage and are the main way to damage opponents.\n* **<span style="color: purple">Move:</span>**  A <ins>Move</ins> Technique is designated by a purple background and the <img :src="$move" style="height:1em" /> symbol. Move Techniques typically provide a great deal of mobility.\n* **<span style="color: gold">Support:</span>** <ins>Support</ins> Techniques are designated by a yellow background and the <img :src="$support" style="height:1em" /> symbol. These Techniques typically target allies, and provide them with valuable resources such as _Momentum_ or _Vigor_ or can allow them to move about during battle.\n* **<span style="color: darkgreen">Defensive:</span>** A <ins>Defensive</ins> Technique is designated by a green background and the <img :src="$defensive" style="height:1em" /> symbol. Defensive Techniques typically make using Resist Maneuvers easier or otherwise enhance your ability to survive.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe remainder of the Technique is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Technique; they are simply here for a comprehensive definition.\n* **Cost** is an up-front cost of a Technique that must be paid when the Technique is played, typically while _Plotting_.\n* **Requirements** are some sort of prerequisite that must be fulfilled before a Technique can be used. \nThis Requirement does not have to be fulfilled when it is played, but does have to be true when the Technique would be used.\n* **Weapon** is a somewhat specialized requirement; if this Technique references _Weapon Attacks_ they must be made using the Weapon type specified by this field.\n* **Target** is what the Technique is going to actually effect. Typically this is a creature, but some Techniques specify that they must target _Features_ or something similar.\n* **Movement** is how far the Technique allows you to move, typically either None, _Step_, _Reposition_, or _Dash_. Refer to your Armor\'s Movement Chart to see how far each of these Movements allows you to go. If a Reaction allows you to use a Technique you do not use its Movement.\n* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Technique. This varies greatly from Technique to Technique, but the Effect box is typically the bulk of what a Technique accomplishes.\n* **Special** is a secondary effect of the Technique, that is typically either conditional or more specific than the primary effect.\n* **Imbue** is an additional Cost you can pay when playing Technique (typically in the Plotting Phase) to increase the effectiveness of a Technique. This often changes the Speed or AP of a Technique, hence why it must be applied when played.\n* **Enhance** is an additional cost that is paid when a Technique is used to amplify its power. This additional cost is purely optional, but can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of a Technique.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe last potential field in a Technique is it\'s **Profile**, discussed below.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Reading Attack

abilities, and knowledge to inform their decisions. \n&nbsp;\n\nNarrative play in Shattered Spirits is typically fast-paced and requires few dice rolls; a character's Archetype, Talents, and Spiritcraft provide fairly strict guidance on what a character is capable of through Triggers, as well as  specific abilities that can be used to enhance their results.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Skill Challenges\nIn many situations, dice are not needed to resolve a situation in Shattered Spirits. If a character has an ability that lists 'Strong' as one of its Triggers, they should be able to accomplish many strength-based tasks without consulting the dice. As a general rule of thumb, if there is no time constraint, minimal consequences to failure, and the character can simply retry something as-needed then a character with the appropriate Triggers should simply succeed in the task. A character's Triggers and magic can accomplish many things without the need to create a skill challenge, and a character's investments should be respected.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever, when the stakes are high or the outcome is unclear characters must make a Skill Challenge using their Stakes Sheet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst, a character should describe how they're attempting to solve a problem. Based on that, the GM will determine two things: whether the roll is **Cautious** or **Bold** as well as what the **Stakes** are, shown below.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img :src=\"$stakes\"  style=\"display: block; margin: auto\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStakes are, simply put, the good or bad things that can happen during a skill challenge. **Augments** tend to increase how much you succeed by, while **Dangers** are hazards and pitfalls that can occur along the way. The GM will first decide at least one automatic stake that happens regardless of the dice roll, whether that be an **Augment** or **Danger**. In addition, your GM will highlight a few potential **Dangers**, as well as what **Augments** may be relevant.\n&nbsp;\n\nCharacters will then determine how many dice they roll. Players automatically roll 2 dice for this check, but may gain or lose die ones based on a variety of factors:\n* If a character has appropriate Equipment for the situation, they gain an additional die.\n* If a character has an appropriate Tag or their magic or spirit would be helpful, they gain an additional die, or two if it is an exceptionally good fit. This may trigger multiple times, up to a maximum of 3 die.\n* If a character has done work to prepare for a situation or has set up some other advantage, they may gain a die.\n* A character may take 1 **Stress** to gain an additional die. In some circumstances the GM may decide that the character must take 1 **Fatigue** instead, typically for checks that occur over a long timespan such as Travel.\n* If a character has a condition that would hinder their ability to succeed, they may lose a die.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point, a character may take 1 **Stress** to swap from Bold to Cautious, or vice versa. Additionally, if characters have abilities that allow them to modify the Stakes sheet, they may use them here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter determining the character's die pool, characters roll their d6s. A result of 1-2 is a &#8863;, a result of 3-4 is a &#9634;, and a result of 5-6 is a &#8862;. If acting **Cautiously**, characters reroll &#9634; and &#8862;, while if they are rolling **Boldly** they reroll &#8863; and &#9634;. If a character is rolling **Skillfully** (usually from some ability), they may reroll dice of their choice. If a character does not wish to reroll, they may take 1 **Stress** to use their initial result.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter completing rolls, characters assign their available dice to Augments and Dangers. The GM then narrates the scene, applies appropriate consequences and conditions, and the adventure continues.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Using Spiritcraft\nA character's Spirit Talents will outline the general guidelines of how a character's spiritcraft may be used. For checks that fit perfectly within these bounds characters may freely use their spiritcraft. A character may temporarily push beyond the limits of their spiritcraft (either in terms of power or duration, such as using their craft for an entire day) but must mark either _Fatigue_ or _Stress_ (GM's choice) for their Spirit when they do so.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Group Checks\nIn many cases multiple party members may wish to attempt a skill challenge, or it may make narrative sense for the entire party to participate. In these cases, have each character attempt their own individual components of the skill challenge, but always include the following stake: <u>Aid (Advantage)</u>: Any dice placed on this Augment can be given to an ally, who rolls once and adds the result of those die to their result.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Abbreviated Skill Challenge\nIn general, characters should either be able to automatically do something, be unable to do something, or begin a Skill Challenge. However, in some situations, there might be a question of whether or not a character can succeed, but it isn't worth consulting an entire stakes sheet for the scenario. In such cases, a GM should determine how many &#8862; are needed to succeed, as well as a single penalty for failure. The character will create their dice pool as normal then roll, counting up the number of &#8862; they achieved. Characters do not reroll due to attempting something **Cautiously**, **Boldly**, or **Skillfully** in an Abbreviated Skill Challenge. If a character achieves enough &#8862; they succeed; otherwise, they fail.\n\n&nbsp;\nWhen a skill check is called for in combat, an Abbreviated Skill Challenge is always attempted. Typically, there is no penalty for failing beyond the resources spent to attempt this.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Narrative Resources\n\nIn narrative play characters must manage their Health and Spirit Bars.\n&nbsp;\nA character's Health Bar represents their general wellbeing and tracks several potential conditions; Stress, Fatigue, and Wounds, as well as more specialized variants of those.\n&nbsp;\n\n* Stress represents a character's mental state. Stress is easy to gain and cannot typically be cleared simply through rest; it requires the assistance of allies and resources to clear. Stress on its own has no impact, but can rapidly fill a character's Health Bar.\n* Fatigue is general physical ills caused from long hikes, combat, and the labors of adventuring. Fatigue can be cleared with sufficient rest. In combat, characters gain 1 _Block_ for each Fatigue at the start of the Round.\n    * Hunger and Thirst are variants of Fatigue caused by not having enough to eat or drink. Rather than clearing with rest, these are instead cleared when an extra portion of food or drink are consumed, although only one of each may be cleared per day.\n* Wounds are the most serious of injuries, and represent distinct physical injuries. The severity of a wound is measured in the number of segments it takes up, with more segments corresponding to a worse wound. Each wound is bespoke and carries with it a Condition Clock, which must be full before the Wound can be downgraded to a Fatigue. Additionally, this Condition Clock will make certain skill challenges more difficult and inflict and appropriate status effect on the character at the start of each round of combat.\n&nbsp;\n\nCommon effects that fills the Health Bar are as follows:\n* Characters can take Stress to push themselves and gain additional effects on skill checks.\n* Characters automatically gain 1 Fatigue when participating in combat, and Fatigue is typically an automatic stake for traveling.\n* If a character is _Downed_ in combat, they roll for _Wounds_ (see the combat rules).\n* If a character does not have food or water for a day they gain Hunger or Thirst, as appropriate.\n&nbsp;\n\nA character's Spirit Bar represents their reserves of magic as well as the physical health of their spirit, which are represented by Stress, Fatigue and Wounds, the same as a character. Spirits typically cannot receive medical attention, and use the <u>Channel</u> _Camp Action_ to clear Wounds or <u>Pamper</u> to clear Stress.\n&nbsp;\n\nCommon things that fill the Spirit Bar are as follows:\n* Participating in combat always causes 1 Fatigue.\n* Using spirit abilities or pushing your limits (using an ability for an entire travel day, for example) may cause your Spirit to gain _Fatigue_.\n* If a Spirit is manifested for the majority of a day of travel, they gain _Fatigue_.\n* _Fatigue_ for your Spirit is a common stake for challenges.\n* If a spirit assists you in in a challenge,  split **Injury** Dangers between the two of you.\n* If your spirit falls in combat they take _Wounds_, rolling as normal.\n&nbsp;\n\nIf a character's Spirit Bar is ever filled they cannot use magic and their spirit is incapable of helping in tasks or combat, although they may still be manifested. A character may inflict a Wound on their spirit to be able to use their magic for a single Scene.\n&nbsp;\n\nIf a character's spirit gauge is full and is all Wounds the character's spirit is put into critical condition and will die if not placed within a powerful source of its element in short order. If a spirit dies its character loses all spiritcraft. Losing a spirit causes significant psychological harm and tends to mark the end of a spiritbound's career as an adventurer.\n\n&nbsp;\nIf a character gains a condition and the appropriate bar is full, instead upgrade the lowest rank effect in that bar to the next tier (Stress->Fatigue->Wound). If upgrading Stress or Fatigue, also inflict a Condition on the character with 2-4 segments. For example, if a character was forced to upgrade a Hunger to a Wound, they might gain the Condition 'Starving', and be unable to clear Hunger until that clock was full.\n&nbsp;\nAdditionally, how full a character's _Health Bar_ is has an impact on their abilities. If a character's _Health Bar_ is full but not all _Wounds_ they roll one less die on every roll. If a character's _Health Bar_ is full and all _Wounds_ they are instead incapable of further adventure; pushing themselves beyond this point could mean certain death. Taking an additional _Wound_ will result in the character's death, and taking a _Fatigue_ or _Stress_ will carry lasting consequences.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Gameplay Example\n"},2666:function(e,t,a){"use

planned abilities and sudden, spur-of-the-moment decision making. Every _Round_ begins with a _Respite_, a brief pause in the lull of combat before it resumes. Players can use this time to strategize for the coming round, and many battlefield effects will trigger at Respite.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point the round of combat begins. Before the start of each _Phase_, characters select their Stance. After all Stances are selected, _Phase_ 1 begins!. Players and enemies alternate acting, resolving Abilities until a _Phase_ is complete, players can change their Stances before the next Phase, and another begins. Once _Phase_ 4 is over _Respite_ starts and the next _Round_ begins! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAbilities are largely split up into a few main categories:\n* _Attacks_ are abilities that focus on defeating or debuffing foes. Attacks may be used at any point on your _Turn_, although you may only use one on your _Turn_.\n* _Maneuvers_ are special abilities that characters can use on their _Turn_. These are abilities like _Run_, which allows you to move further, or _Manifest_, which allows you to summon your Spirit. A character can use any number of _Manuevers_ on their _Turn_, but a given _Manuever_ can only be used once per _Turn_.\n* _Reactions_ are abilities that can be used at any time. These are powerful defensive abilities like _Brace_, as well as things that allow you to punish foes, such as _Opportunity Attack_. Characters may use any number of _Reactions_, but a specific Trigger may only prompt a single _Reaction_.\n* _Gambits_ are specialized abilities that enhance Attacks. Whenever a character rolls doubles or rolls a _Critical Hit_ they may apply a _Gambit_, or apply two if both conditions are true.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn combat there are a few main resources that a character must manage:\n* _Momentum_ is a character's primary mechanism for doing more in combat. Most _Blockts_, _Reactions_, _Gambits_, and many Attacks cost _Momentum_. _Momentum_ is gained from your _Stances_ during _Respite_, by abilities such as _Focus_, and by missing Attacks.\n* _Movement_ is used by characters to traverse the battlefield and fuel high-mobility abilities. Characters have a small pool of _Movement_ that they may spend whenever it is their _Turn_. Additionally, many _Techniques_ and _Actions_ will provide additional _Movement_ that a character may use.\n* _Stamina_ is a character's primary defensive resource, which can be spent to fuel defensive Reactions and ensure a character's survival.\n* _Stamina_ is a measure of a character's current Stamina in combat. If a character's _Stamina_ hits 0 they aren't immediately defeated; instead, they gain _Wounds_ which make continuing combat more difficult.\n* _Vigor_ is a pool of pseudo-Stamina that is always lost prior to _Stamina_. _Vigor_ never stacks; a character must either gain nothing or replace their current value when they would gain _Vigor_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShattered Spirits uses a zone-based combat system where rather than a battlemap consisting of hexes or spaces there are simply different areas, called Arenas, where combatants can be. Each _Arena_ represents a distinct environment in the battlefield with its own terrain and hazards.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWithin each _Arena_ are a number of _Positions_, which represent the approximate positioning of characters and objects within said _Arena_. Most _Arenas_ can have any number of _Positions_, and it typically takes only a single _Movement_ to move between _Positions_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe avenues between _Arenas_ are called _Paths_ and represent the distance and hazards in between different _Arenas_. It always takes at least one _Movement_ to move between _Arenas_, although it typically costs more due to environmental effects.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRange is based on the number of _Arenas_. _Melee_ effects can be used at your _Position_, while _Short_ Range may target anything in your _Arena_ that is not at your _Position_. _Reach_ Range may target any creature within your _Arena_. _Medium_ Range may target within an adjacent _Arena_, and _Long_ Range may target two _Arenas_ away. Effects may ONLY use their listed Range; a _Short_ Range effect could not target something at your _Position_, for example.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinally, characters need to carefully manage their _Sources_ and ensure that they don't fall victim to a condition that makes it difficult to use their spirit powers! \n* Flamebound act as _Suppressed_ when _Armored_ or at a _Position_ with _Water_ _Terrain_, and _Sealed_ when _Swimming_ in Water.\n* Earthbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user has no _Source_ at their _Position_, and _Sealed_ when there is no _Source_ in their _Arena_ or the user is _Flying_.\n* Waterbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user is _Alight_, and _Sealed_ if there is no _Source_ in any adjacent _Area_.\n* Windbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user is underground and _Sealed_ when the user is fully encased in _Earth_, such as when _Restrained_ by an _Earth_ Ability.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCombat typically continues until the players succeed or fail their objective for the battle. This can be something as simple as defeating all their enemies or more complicated, such as holding specific objectives on the battlefield for a set duration. Your Spirit Master will explain how to win at the beginning of combat, as well as answer any rules questions that you may have during the battle. Good luck, and may you and your spirit find success on the battlefield!\n\n",o=(a(4847),a(8361),i["default"].extend({name:"combat-primer",computed:{combatText(){return

In addition, most have adopted physical traits that are reminiscent of their spirit. For most this manifests as a stereotypical hair or eye color, but some have more extreme expressions, such as a glowing tattoo-like scar, stony skin, or hair that always flows as if in the wind. Your character can be anywhere from a standard human to somebody with heavy feline features, vibrant hair that flickers like flames, and eyes like burning coals.\n&nbsp;\n\nAs important as your spiritbound's appearance is, the appearance of their spirit is just as important. Spirits tend to take the appearance of a small creature, with the general trends outlined earlier in the 'Choosing Your Spirit' section. While they tend towards a specific type of animal, it's not uncommon for spirits' physical forms to be a bit of a hybrid of several different animals. Most spirit's default forms are small enough to comfortably fit on a human's shoulder, although some get as large as a cat or small dog.\n&nbsp;\n\nThe physical form of a spirit tends to take cues from the Techniques and Stances their spiritbound most often makes use of. If a spiritbound primarily specializes in the elemental control disciplines, their spirit is often largely comprised of that element. A windbound that specializes in the Storm Discipline might have a spirit whose physical form is largely comprised of lightning. Spiritbound that specialize in the emotional discipline of their spirit tend to have spirits that are a bit more ghostly and ethereal in nature. Finally, spiritbound that specialize in the physical and sensory applications often have spirits that trend closer to an actual animal in appearance, although they still have odd markings or some indication of their elemental alignment.",m="### Creating Your Background\nY'all have played an RPG, will flesh this out later.",f="### Finalizing Your Character\nYou 25 Stamina!

Oceans burn and mountains fly yet, through it all, humanity perseveres.\n&nbsp;\nHumanities only saving grace in this world are their ever-present element companion. These spirits provide companionship, insight and, perhaps mostly importantly, mastery of the elements themselves. Together humanity and their bound spirits have found a place within this shattered world, forging bonds and conquering obstacles with their shared strength and carving out meager existences in the liminal spaces between the realms of greater spirits.\n&nbsp;\n<img v-if="isMobile" :src="$jenna" v-bind:class="mobileOrNormal(\'circle\')" />\n<img v-else :src="$jenna" class="circle earth-border" style="float: right!important; margin-left: 2em" />\nThese fragile spaces are under threat.

Located on a wide peninsula and cut off from the rest of the continent by a mountain range that seems to reach the sky, the Greenvale is spared the worst of rampaging spirits.\n&nbsp;\nThat is not, to say, that the Greenvale is without its dangers. Thick forests cover much of the peninsula, and the creatures within do not take kindly to wanderers. The plenty of the land has lead to more settlements than other regions and, with them, conflict between the various groups. A true pillaging or invasion would risk the wrath of a town's Guardian, but homesteaders and others that live outside the proper bounds of a village must remain ever vigilant not only against the threat of other spirits, but also raiders from the less scrupulous villages.\n&nbsp;\n### Settlements of the Greenvale\n##### Serpent Village\n##### Phoenix Village\n##### Ironwing Village\n##### The Rainchasers\n&nbsp;\n### The Great Spirits of Greenvale\n##### Fangs of the Deep Wood\n##### Hooves Thunder Above\n##### Arms Dance Like Waves\n##### The Coiled Mountaintop",d="### Civilization in the Shattered World\nHumanity persists in the Shattered World, but the presence of spirits has forced civilization to adapt. Spirits can be viciously territorial, and the destruction of their domain to create houses is not looked upon favorably. This has forced small groups of humans to settle into towns between the domains of more hostile spirits.\n&nbsp;\n### Guardian Spirits\nWere it not for a town's Guardian, roaming beasts and spirits would likely have destroyed the last shreds of humanity long ago. To call these spirits a Guardian is a charitable interpretation of their goals; in reality, it would be better to call the relationship between a Guardian and their village a symbiotic, if mildly parasitic one. Guardians are a spirit of sufficient power to keep other spirits out of their territory but, for whatever reason, are able to tolerate the presence of humans.\n&nbsp;\nAt the center of a village's relationship with their Guardian is the Pact; an informal series of rituals and customs the members of the town take part in to placate their Guardian and assure they remain pacified and present. Informal is the key word in that statement; Guardians, like other spirits, are not capable of speech, and tend to be animalistic in intelligence. The Pact is not a formally codified set of terms and conditions, but rather an ever-evolving series of practices learned through trial and error. Groups that are not able to maintain their Pact rarely last long, as they either draw the wrath of their Guardian or drive their Guardian away, leaving them vulnerable to all manner of spirits.\n&nbsp;\nHow exactly this relationship develops varies from town to town, and depends quite heavily on the Pact. Some villages have simple, lenient Pacts that cause them to develop a positive impression of their Guardian. This has, in the past, been the bane of many villages that became too comfortable with their arrangement and did not properly respect how fickle and dangerous their Guardian could be. In other cases, the Pact is extremely oppressive, forcing towns to specialize in odd ways or bend their way of life drastically, leading to resentment towards their Guardian.\n&nbsp;\n### Towns and Villages\nSmall villages and towns dot the landscape of the Shattered World, spread into the small safe spaces where they can flourish. Most tend to be small, numbering in the hundreds of people, and heavily influenced by their Guardian spirit and what they do to placate them. Ironwing Village, for example, has an inordinate number of smiths that spend much of their days producing metallic flowers to keep the deadly swarm of metallic butterfly spirits occupied. Most also tend to work the motif of their spirit into their day to day lives, frequently sporting tattoos or decorated clothing that matches their Guardian.\n&nbsp;\nTowns, unfortunately, do have a limit on how many people they can support. Once available land is gone and there is nowhere nearby to establish a homestead, towns struggle to support the population. Once this happens people tend to leave, either to find a town with better opportunities or, if they are particularly bold, to find a new Guardian and establish their own.\n&nbsp;\n### Trade and Currency\n&nbsp;\nWhile fertile land, access to water and other common constraints are important for creating a town the limitations of finding a Guardian have caused settlements to be scattered across the landscape. Most are at least several days apart, if not more. This makes large-scale trade between towns somewhat difficult. Most beasts of burden struggle to traverse the Shattered World, and wagons would be all but impossible. Anything that too closely resembles a road tends to be destroyed by curious earth spirits, and any shipments by boat must be carefully protected to ensure nearby water spirits are not angered. There are impromptu networks of 'road shrines'; small constructions scattered between towns that travelers can put offerings in, with the goal to eventually coax the local spirits to help guide travelers that way to earn a reward. This has been met with mixed success, but seems promising.\n&nbsp;\nAt this point, there is not a strong concept of currency within the Shattered World. While it can be found in old ruins, it doesn't have much intrinsic worth. Within towns trade is a very loose concept; with few exceptions, people trade labor and supplies readily and do their best to support the community. Between towns, trade largely functions on a barter system, whether that be precious pelts, raw resources, or specialized manufactured goods.\n&nbsp;\n### Conflict Between Towns\nOn the surface, towns typically do their best to assist one another; with the forced specialization that accommodating a Guardian requires and the shortage of resources, some level of cooperation is required. Most towns abide by strict rules of hospitality, and harming a traveler is a near universal evil. This, however, does not mean that everything is peaceful between villages.\n&nbsp;\nRaids by bandits are not uncommon and while they are typically people living outside the bounds of towns and such, sometimes 'bandits' are in-reality another town raiding for supplies. These conflicts tend to be brief, well-planned and violent, with bandits getting in and out before the Guardian or concentrated defenses can react. Homesteaders, with their limited protection, are a common target for bandits and the like, and need to be constantly on guard.\n&nbsp;\nActually conquering a village is nearly impossible. While Guardians are fickle and dangerous, most seem to have some level of affection for their wards, and killing them will likely make that spirit no longer a suitable Guardian. Conquering a town would require turning the Guardian against the current residents, a lofty proposition for even the most cunning of spiritbound.\n&nbsp;\n### Homesteaders\nWhile most folks live in towns, it's rare that a Guardian has a large enough domain and would be alright with large fields. That is the domain of homesteaders; farmers, ranchers, and other occupations that require significant land. They find small areas that aren't sufficient for a town, but could support a family or two and a field. They tend to have a much simpler relationship with their local spirit. These spirits lack the power of a Guardian, but tend to be easier to deal with as a result. It's not uncommon for homesteaders to fight alongside their local spirit when other spirits attempt to intrude, forming a much more symbiotic relationship.\n&nbsp;\nTechnically, homesteaders just need an area they can build and put down roots and do not require the aid of a spirit like a town would. Due to this, some will kill an area's spirit rather than attempting to cooperate. This tends to work well in the short term, but often results in the homesteader constantly contending with new spirits attempting to establish a domain there and, without significant effort, the area will tend to degrade without a spirit tied to it.\n&nbsp;\nWhether due to living in harsher conditions or being more closely tied to a spirit, homesteaders seem to have an enhanced capability with their craft and almost always manifest larger spirits than people who live in towns.\n&nbsp;\n### Inns\nFinally, existing outside the typical structure listed above, are inns. Towns rarely have a dedicated inn, instead allowing travelers use of spare beds in residents' homes. Throughout the wilds, usually at somewhat natural crossroads are inns, living far beyond the bounds that even homesteaders risk. They are a welcome respite for travelers, and most journeys are structured to take advantage of these locations.\n&nbsp;\nInnkeepers are nearly always eccentrics and incredibly capable spiritbound. They have chosen to risk the wilds rather than a town, and constantly deal with all manner of travelers. The payment they require lacks any standardization; sometimes, information is enough for a room, while other times they might require a specific request or specialized items. They are almost as dangerous to deal with as a spirit, but have a wealth of knowledge that is difficult to match.",h="### John and Kit\n*An apprentice smith and wannabe swordmaster with a metallic spider companion.*\n&nbsp;\nThe current apprentice blacksmith of the town, John is kind, dutiful, and painfully shy. Even among the others his age in town John is a bit of an enigma, although Winona swears she has seen John practicing swordfighting in the forge at night. His is closest with Marlon, and absolutely terrified of Margaret.\n&nbsp;\n\nJohn has a wiry, rugged build, silvery hair, and three metallic mole-like growths beside either eye that are reminiscent of a spider's eyes. He tends to wear bland, ill-fitting clothes, and tends to proudly wear a sword he made himself across his back.\n&nbsp;\nJohn was adopted by Ruger, the town's blacksmith, and has spent more time in the forge than anybody his age should. He's a capable smith and would likely be content to do it for the rest of his life were it not for romantic notions of swordfighting intruding on that complacency. John struggles to connect with others and has decided that mastering the blade is the best way to overcome this shortcoming.\n\n&nbsp;\n If he becomes a master of the sword people will attribute meaning to his awkward silences, need him for things beyond horseshoes and hoes and, most importantly, think he is the coolest guy in town. His peers have noticed, although not quite in the way he wanted; they're all more than a bit concerned that something has happened to John; whenever somebody attempts to talk to him he's taken to resting his hand on the pommel of his sword, nodding, then abruptly leaving.\n&nbsp;\n\nKit, John's companion, is a small metal spirit that is vaguely spider shaped, but is better described as an orb with four legs, a series of black metallic eyes, and a stem-like growth coming out of the middle of its bulbous form that almost forms a hat. It can also extrude thin metal wire not unlike spidersilk, something that John and Ruger make endless use of in the forge. It's an odd creature and more than slightly offputting in appearance, but is often seen on John's back like some sort of odd backpack. Kit loves to snack on things made of tin and hates birds.\n&nbsp;\n",p=a(6084),m="### Margaret and Queen\n*A farmgirl that desperately wants to get away from Serpent Village and her large, imposing earth spirit that can easily be distracted with fetch.*\n&nbsp;\nPart of a small group of homesteaders, Margaret has had a rougher upbringing. Outside the bounds of Serpent Village life is innately harder, and Margaret has been used to fighting spirits and long treks to and from her farm for a long time. Within the town, she's closest with Blaine and constantly struggles with Erika's attitude.\n&nbsp;\nMargaret is a towering figure, standing a full head above most of her peers. She has broad shoulders and skin that has been heavily tanned from working in the sun constantly. Her eyes add to the intimidation factor; her irises are shaped like a cut gem and faintly glow a soft purple, matching Queen's eyes.\n&nbsp;\nHaving spent her time on a homestead, Margaret has always had a more positive impression of Serpent Village than her peers; coming to town meant a reprieve from work, exciting supplies, and other novelties that did not exist in her home. It also meant an escape from the Goat of the Cave, the spirit her small farm dealt with for their farmland. While not particularly dangerous, part of the deal with the Goat of the Cave seemed to be that it was allowed to intrude on their dreams, leading to a variety of unpleasant dairy-themed dreams.\n&nbsp;\nRight now, Margaret's dream is to establish her own homestead away from the Goat of the Cave and perhaps a bit closer to Serpent Village. That, however, is easier said than done. Finding an area with an amicable spirit that would allow establishing a farm is always difficult, and the area around Serpent Village seems to be all but exhausted.\n&nbsp;\nMargaret's spirit is Queen, a massive bear-like dog (or perhaps dog-like bear) made of soil and stone. Queen manifested early for Margaret (a common occurrence for homesteaders) and, perhaps because of that, has a strong protective instinct. She is a friendly spirit, although does not quite seem to grasp her own size and weight. Margaret loves cheese and hates goats. She is indifferent on goat cheese.",f=JSON.parse('{"stamina":10,"move":2,"stun":0,"momentum":0,"vigor":0,"current_stance":"Open Stance","arts":["Strong","Wanderer","Farmer","Basic Earthsense","Basic Landcraft","Novice Mountaincraft"],"disciplines":[],"element":"Earth","name":"Margaret","player_character":true,"spirit":{"stamina":20,"type":"Earth Spirit","move":1,"stun":0,"momentum":0,"vigor":0,"name":"Queen","traits":["Large Form","Moderately Armored","Strong Jaws","Shepherding Instinct","Pack Animal"],"current_stance":"Spiritual Essence"},"equipped":["Stone Maul","Hunting Sling","Iron Helmet","Heavy Armor","Reinforced Armor","Chain Shirt","Iron Plating","Health Flask","Flask of Earthen Power","Traveler\'s Boots"],"packed":["Waterskin","Bandages","Bedroll","Rations","Tent","Hard Cheese","Hard Cheese","Hard Cheese","Ball","Forest Shrine Offering","Rope","Forest Shrine Offering"]}'),_="\n### Erika, Vicki, and Belle\n*An artist and enjoyer of herbs with a two-headed antelope companion.*\n&nbsp;\nWhile she is technically the apprentice herbalist in Serpent Village, Erika is better known as a troublemaker and slacker within the town. She would much rather practice her sculptures or try to splice two random plants together than actually deal with the mundanity of work. She is very close with Winona (who constantly covers for her), and is constantly fighting with Blaine.\n&nbsp;\n\nErika is rarely seen without flowers in her hair (that sprout there naturally due to her elemental bond) and covering slightly more of her clothing than might be considered reasonable. She exercises her craft easily and often, and constantly adorns herself with simple but impossible plant growths. In theory she would be a poor candidate for the town guard, but Vicki and Belle are so ferocious that they more than compensate for her generally calm demeanor. More importantly, almost all of the town guard shifts are exceptionally boring, providing an excellent opportunity to slack off.\n\n&nbsp;\nDespite her slacking, Erika has a (somewhat) noble goal: find a way to make a tree that can grow Dreamweed, grow that tree into an elegant and magnificent crown-shaped and giant-serpent-head-sized sculpture, and let the town relax a little bit more with The Great Serpent a bit more pacified. This is, of course, a long ways from completion and, at least for now, Erika would much rather relax and make friends within the village.\n&nbsp;\n\nVicki and Belle are Erika's spirit; an antelope-like creature woven from bark and vines, covered in small vibrant flowers and berries and, naturally, has two heads. Erika is quite adamant that Vicki and Belle have distinct personalities and act differently, although nobody else in the town seems to be able to tell the difference. Vicki and Belle are incredibly friendly and can be found roaming the town at all times. They love children and sugar and hate cats.",g=a(7949),y="### Winona and Pepper\n*A skilled archer and capable hunter who's icy demeanor is undermined by her jovial winged rat wind spirit.*\n&nbsp;\nA harsh and brusque member of Serpent Village, Winona and her family live just on the outskirts of town, and are well-known as accomplished hunters and foragers. Others tend to be scared to approach her and she is constantly in conflict with Marlon, although Erika swears that, once you get past her shell, Winona is actually quite sweet.\n&nbsp;\nThe display of her elemental connection is a bit more prominent in Winona than most; she has wispy clouds instead of hair that (unfortunately for her) tend to lighten or darken with her mood. They are typically a mild grey. Because of this, she tends to wear a hooded cloak to draw a little less attention. She is strong and wiry from years of using a bow, and typically does her best to blend into the scenery.\n&nbsp;\nWinona is one of the town's most reliable hunters and has been from a frighteningly young age, somehow always finding food even when the woods seemed empty. She's far more comfortable in the woods and the silence it brings, but seems to get far too into every event or festival she's included in. Nobody knows about it, but she's kept a collection of pelts to try to trade for a nice dress at the Silver Sky Festival, although she hasn't quite figured out how to accomplish that trade without Marlon noticing.\n&nbsp;\nUnlike the others, Winona struggles to come up with a grand goal. Right now, she's swamped with trying to keep the rest of her family fed, as her father seems to have a kind but difficult habit of taking in anybody that needs help, resulting in her having six younger adopted siblings. She hopes that someday she can make a trip out to Squidport and see the sea, but it's not quite time for that. If pressed hard, she'll admit that she wants to someday hunt the wandering beasts of the Greenvale and stop their rampage across the region.\n&nbsp;\nWinona's spirit, Pepper, is almost the complete opposite of her facade. A small furry rodent of indeterminate species, Pepper has two iridescent butterfly-like wings and enjoys nothing more than flying around the town, greeting other villagers, and collecting small objects. The only reason people know Winona is in town is typically because Pepper is out and about. Pepper loves bananas (even though he's only had one, they don't grow near Serpent Village) and absolutely hates the smell of most herbs.",b=a(1575),v="Spirits are everywhere within the Shattered World and influence every aspect of it. They are wild, dangerous creatures formed from element power, enjoying immense potential in their element and able to contend with anything the Shattered World throws their way. In many ways, they tend to act as animals, forming packs, protecting their territory, and other recognizable behaviors. However, behind this, there is always a slightly alien intelligence that humans struggle to understand, and misunderstanding why a spirit is doing something is a common cause for conflict. Spirits are never evil but, like a wild animal or a storm, are always dangerous.\n&nbsp;\nSpirits are as innumerable as grains of sand and, while there are trends in their behavior, they seem to find great joy in defying any attempts to classify them into discrete types. That said, the below categorizations seem to be true more often than not.\n&nbsp;\n### Earth Spirits\nSpirits of earth tend to take the form of animals known for their strength and stamina, although many lesser earth spirits take the form of small burrowing animals such as moles. Regardless, it's rare for an earth spirit to ever fully leave the ground; typically, just the head is visible above the ground, with the body remaining hidden underground. Earth spirits are typically stubborn and slow to change like the earth itself, but are a reliable companion.\n&nbsp;\n### Flame Spirits\nFlame spirits are commonly found in the form of predators and hunters, favoring feline and reptilian forms. They are fully capable of controlling their flames and can will them to not burn others, although its rare for a flame spirit to accept physical touch. They are spirits of extreme laziness, often content to remain a smoldering fire and not move for extended periods and incredible violence as they seek more fuel for their flame. They are a powerful but capricious companion.\n&nbsp;\n### Metal Spirits\nSpirits of metal are rare, odd spirits that do not typically manifest as large creatures. They prefer the form of insects, crustaceans, and other armored animals. They have a reputation for being cold, but whether this is a real trait or a side-effect of their forms being difficult to read for humans is up for debate. Regardless, they tend to be stalwart but incomprehensible spirits.\n&nbsp;\n### Water Spirits\nWater spirits are ever flowing and take myriad, fluid forms although ocean-dwelling creatures and snakes tend to be common forms. They tend to take the path of least resistance, and are a calm, moderate spirit. They can exist for extended periods without water, although they take great joy in swimming and being submerged. They are typically considered the easiest spirit to deal with, as they will frequently avoid combat just on the basis of peace being easier.\n&nbsp;\n### Wind Spirits\nSpirits of wind tend to take the form of nimble, agile animals, especially those that can fly. Wind spirits are rarely ever fully formed even when they materialize; often small portions of their form remain wispy and wraith-like with little corporeal element. They are flighty, unpredictable spirits but are rarely actively malicious, simply a bit destructive in their whims.\n&nbsp;\n### Wood Spirits\nWood spirits are common and spread throughout the world, dwelling inside every plant. Those that decide to manifest are fond of small mammals, particularly those that are well-suited for climbing. Wood spirits seem to be a bit more intelligent than the other types, and tend to have an almost human sense of humor.\n&nbsp;\n### Hybrid Elements\nWhile the above categories tend to hold true, many spirits within the world are some combination of elements. This typically results in some melding of their personalties, but can always have unpredictable outcomes.\n&nbsp;\n### Bound Spirits\nEveryone in the Shattered World is bound to a spirit, a manifestation of elemental power that takes an animalistic form. Sometime before puberty children will face their Binding; a dream where they first meet their spirit and form their initial connection. In the coming weeks the spirit begins to take physical form, and the child's craft begins to awaken. While the physical aspect takes time, the bond between spirit and companion begins as soon as the Binding is complete, and the comforting presence of their spirit sharing space in their mind is established. The relationship is deeper than a simple pet and owner; both parties are equal in the relationship and share an empathetic bond, giving them a deep insight into one another. In most cases spirits and their companion share a deep bond, although in same cases incompatible personalities can result in a more fraught relationship.\n&nbsp; \nUnlike other spirits, bound spirits seem to follow more strict bounds, likely due to the human influence. They are commonly between the size of a rat and a horse, manifest with obvious animal traits, and only ever are influenced by a single element. Typically, when a bound spirit first appears its form is a bit more amorphous but, over time, tends to settle into a more defined form, although this sometime does not happen until their companion is well into adulthood. Bound spirits can take physical form or return to a more purely-elemental form at a whim, although most keep their spirit manifested as much as possible.\n&nbsp;\nThe bond between a spirit and their companion is, in addition to its benefits, dangerous. If one half of a pair dies and the other survives, the other is certainly soon to follow. Losing your spirit is beyond simply losing a pet or a companion; they are a piece of one another, and the hole that is left behind can never be filled. If the spirit dies, the human tends to struggle with intense depression, wastes away, and slowly loses access to their craft. If they survive the first few months after the loss of a spirit they can live a few years, but typically do not make it longer. A spirit fades away much more quickly if their companion dies; they last on an order of days or weeks before simply dissipating. In some cases, the spirit might go on a rampage after their companion's death, avenging them and attempting to resolve any lingering regrets. Undertakers are incredibly important due to this, not only to ensure the dead are treated with respect but to not anger their spirit. In extreme cases, a bound spirit can become a daemon after their companion dies, although these cases are exceedingly rare.\n&nbsp;\n### Dormant Spirits\nMuch of the spirits within the world are dormant; they do not take physical form, and tend to not react to stimulus. Whether this be because they are weak or simply asleep varies, but everything within the world is infused with spirits, from the smallest stone to the largest mountain. In general, these spirits exert very little influence on the world, but permeate every aspect of it.\n### Wild Spirits\nWild spirits are much of the world, and have little to no consistency in their demeanor. They permeate everything, as shapeless elemental forces active in the world and as physical creatures, similar to Bound Spirits, that take action within the world. They tend to be strongly linked with a specific element or subset of craft, but can easily be formed from multiple. Wild spirits are what are commonly encountered in the world, especially while traveling, and can either be a potential ally or dangerous foe depending on how they are dealt with. Powerful Wild Spirits will often establish their own territory and learning where to avoid and where is safe is a critical part of traversing the Shattered World.\n### Guardians\nSpirits of great power that, for whatever reason, have traits that make it possible to build a town within their domain. Guardians have slightly more defined traits, mostly because they are a very specific subset of spirits. Among spirits, they tend to be kinder towards humans, less fickle and, of course, powerful enough to keep other spirits at bay from presence alone.\n### Great Spirits\nAmong spirits, Great Spirits stand at the pinnacle. They typically resemble a force of nature more than an actual physical thing and have a vast domain; an entire mountain might be a Great Spirit's purview, with smaller, lesser spirits dividing up the domain among themselves. A Great Spirit is an unstoppable force but, for the most part, they do not tend to act intentionally against anything other than other Great Spirits. That does not mean they are not a concern; the movement or awakening of a Great Spirit is still a calamity unlike most others, and can easily wipe several towns off the map in the blink of an eye.\n### Daemons\nOf all the spirits discussed, there is only one hard rule: they do not speak with the human tongue. There are spirits that can mimic, and some spiritbound can carry their own words through their spirit, but these are simply echoes, not true speech. Every child learns from a young age that they should be cautious of spirits and never anger them and, more importantly, if they ever hear a spirit speak to run as fast and far as they can. Spirits that can speak the human tongue are called Daemons, and, even among spirits, are the most dangerous.\n&nbsp;\nWhat makes a Daemon is unclear, but they are vastly more intelligent and capricious than most spirits. They have egos, goals, and motivations beyond what is typical for spirits, and tend to have immense and strange power. They are the only spirits that adopt humanoid forms, although due to their presence and elemental form none could ever mistake them for a human.",w="### The World Itself\n### Spirit Beasts\n### Locusts\n### The Old World",k="The art of manipulating your element is called spiritcraft and is something that everybody bound to a spirit can do to at least a small degree. Most denizens of the Shattered World go far beyond that though, specializing in specific applications of the craft to make their day-to-day life easier, whether that be practicing specific techniques to heat reagents *just* right or large scale earthcraft to plow a field.\n&nbsp;\n\nSpiritcraft is a highly personalized skillset, with everybody's expression of the same techniques varying ever so slightly. The human is effectively just a conduit for the raw power coming from their spirit, and their visualization and intent shapes how that energy is manifested. In general, for anything beyond the most basic of spiritcraft people will make use of chants, hand signs, or complicated gestures that they have drilled time and time again to minimize the risk of mishap and ensure their intent is manifested properly.\n\n&nbsp;\nWhat spiritcraft can accomplish is constantly evolving, with spiritbound constantly finding new applications for their craft. The only truly hard limit seems to be the elemental one; no matter how one trains, a flame spirit will never be able to create a wall of stone, and a wind spirit will never be able to shape metal like clay. People continue to try to push through this limitation, as wild spirits don't seem to be constrained in the same way, leaving some doubt that this is truly an impossible hurdle.\n\n&nbsp;\nWithin each element there are a handful of different Disciplines, or common forms and techniques for that element. Each element has several broad ways that they can manipulate their element, an emotion linked to their element they can manipulate, a physical enhancement they can draw out, and some sense they can enhance.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Elemental Sense\nAll with craft are able to sense latent spirits that align with their element, although without training and focus this tends to be quite limited. With sufficient effort this can be expanded, with some able to sense their element across vast distances. In dangerous climates many waterbound are pushed to develop this ability as soon as possible.\n&nbsp;\n### Earthcraft\nThose that are Bonded to an earth spirit draw upon the power of the earth and stone, shaping the terrain around them and making both their will and stance as sturdy as the earth itself. With their connection to the earth, earthbonded can amplify both their physical strength spirit many times over, wielding weapons that would be impossible for a normal Bonded to even lift much less make use of. The earth strengthens their spirits to a similar degree, and earthbonded have earned a reputation as either the most courageous or most reckless of warriors, depending on who you ask. Finally, earthbonded are valued extremely highly as scouts, as they can 'see' through the earth itself, allowing them to track enemies across vast distances or see even in impossible visibility.\n&nbsp;\n### Flamecraft\nFlamecraft is most commonly known for producing, controlling, and otherwise manipulating flame, with experts able to create flames that burn only what they wish. With training, they can learn to manipulate heat itself. They can channel the power of the flame inward, burning internally to enhance their physical prowess many times over. Flame is the element of rage and anger, and manipulating that emotion falls within the purview of flamecraft. Finally, by looking into flames flamebound can see into the future, with the quality and relevance of the image depending on their own skill as well as the size of the blaze. Flamecraft is a dangerous discipline, and nearly every flamebound has some significant burn due to a training accident.\n&nbsp;\n### Metalcraft\nA stubborn element, metal refuses to allow itself to be easily manipulated. While a metalbound can never achieve the same degree of mass manipulation as an earth or waterbound, they boast exceptional power and precision with their limited abilities to control metal. Additionally, they have an immense capacity to influence the shape and qualities of metal, making it nigh-indestructible or as weak as paper. Metal is the element of grief, and a metalbound can throw others into deep despair. When focused physically, metalbound gain impossible endurance and resilience that allows them to ignore all but the worst of injuries and push through impossible odds. When used on their sense, metalcraft enhances mundane senses many times over, allowing them to see and hear at exceptional distances.\n&nbsp;\n### Watercraft\nWater is a fluid and graceful element, and the most prized type of craft in much of the world. It's useful for the obvious act of controlling and moving water, but adept practitioners can learn to control its phase and manipulate ice and snow as well. Physically, water and blood are closely linked, and a waterbound can learn to manipulate them as if they were one and the same, providing a horrific weapon or incredible medical skills. When focusing on emotions, water brings a deep sense of calm and peace, and can providing a comforting presence for others. Just as fire can see into the future, water can see the past, with the quality of the effect dependent on their own skill and the quality of the water. By submerging something they can shape this vision, focusing it on said object.\n&nbsp;\n### Windcraft\nThose that are Bonded to an wind spirit draw upon the wild and untamed power of wind and storm. Windbonded can easily unleash powerful gales and blasts of lightning, creating storms every bit as vicious as those found in nature. By imbuing themselves with the essence of wind they can greatly enhance their reaction speed and movement. They can spark the deep, primal fear of the unknown in others, causing lesser foes to flee before them on the battlefield. Finally, their ability to sense through the wind grants a Windbound excellent awareness of the area, allowing them to notice things that few others could hope to find.\n&nbsp;\n### Woodcraft\nWood is the element of growth, and is the only living element that is manipulated. Most woodcraft focuses on controlling long-dead wood that only has spirits within it, controlling and shaping it with a thought. Skilled crafters can instead control living plants, encouraging growth and forcing impossible structures. Physically, wood allows sharing and giving lifeforce between different creatures, allowing others to heal by harming another. By focusing on their senses woodcraft can reveal the emotional state of nearby creatures, reading their aura and determining their current emotional state. Wood is the element of joy, and woodcraft can inspire comforting joy, as well as wild, uncontrollable ecstasy. This ability to force a good reaction often makes others innately distrustful of woodbound, even if they don't specialize in that aspect of the craft.",S=i["default"].extend({name:"world-menu",components:{CustomButton:o.A,ShowCharacter:l.A},data(){return{selectedTab:"The World in Brief",tabs:["The World in Brief","Civilization Now","Spirits","Spiritcraft","Dangers of the Shattered World","The Greenvale","Sample Characters"],text:[c,d,v,k,w,u,""],count:0,characters:[[m,s.KQ.Deserialize(f)],[h,s.KQ.Deserialize(p)],[y,s.KQ.Deserialize(b)],[_,s.KQ.Deserialize(g)]]}}}),A=S,C=a(1656),T=(0,C.A)(A,n,r,!1,null,"b2ddf750",null),M=T.exports},3954:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Controller.deb8a3b6.svg"},4013:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Stealthy.622fe083.svg"},4015:function(e,t,a){"use strict";e.exports=a.p+"img/Prone.9021d9c9.svg"},4035:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a(1635),r=a(2893),i=function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;return t("v-app",{staticClass:"background--color",class:e.fontType,attrs:{id:"app"}},[e.$route.meta.hideHeader?e._e():t("div",[t("Navbar")],1),t("router-view")],1)},s=[],o=function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;return t("div",[t("div",{staticClass:"nav--wrapper"},[t("router-link",{attrs:{to:"/"}},[t("span",{staticClass:"nav--text"},[e._v("Shattered Spirits")])]),t("about",{staticClass:"about d-none d-lg-block"})],1)])},l=[],c=function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;return t("div",[t("v-dialog",{attrs:{"hide-overlay":""},scopedSlots:e._u([{key:"activator",fn:function({on:a}){return[t("v-btn",e._g({attrs:{color:"white"}},a),[e._v(" About ")])]}}]),model:{value:e.dialog,callback:function(t){e.dialog=t},expression:"dialog"}},[t("v-card",[t("v-card-text",{staticClass:"card--wrapper",staticStyle:{"font-size":"larger",padding:"1em"}},[e._v(" Welcome to the world of Deskar, the land of Shattered Spirits!"),t("br"),e._v(" "),t("br"),e._v(" This system is currently a huge WIP and is in the middle of a large revamp of character options.

Traveling in the Shattered World\nThe Shattered World is a beautiful, wild, dangerous place, and travelers leaving the safety of their town or village must be well-prepared. Besides the obvious dangers of hunger, thirst, weather, and dangerous beasts, the Shattered World carries with it other, greater dangers, like impossible weather, territorial spirits and, of course, areas still ravaged by the Shattering itself.\n&nbsp; \n\n### The Phases of a Journey\nPlay in Shattered Spirits is structured around the phases of a Journey. Each Journey represents a trip away from home, and is where the bulk of gameplay comes in.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBefore beginning a Journey, characters first have to find why they're going on a Journey! Common motivations are to find a rare resource or medicine, find a piece of lost knowledge, or to beg a boon from a distant spirit. Early on these motivations will likely be more concrete but, as the players explore the world and make bonds with NPCs, they may come up with journeys that they wish to attempt.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nOnce a goal and destination are decided, characters will then break their Journey down into Legs, which represent the primary stops in the Journey. Some shorter Journeys may only have a single Leg (journey origin to the final destination), but longer Journeys will frequently be comprised of multiple Legs. Typically, each stop will be a place the party can rest, recuperate, and refresh themselves before the next destination. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nOnce players have established their Legs, the GM will assign each a travel distance, which is tracked using a Clock, and create the appropriate Journey Decks. From there, players will play through travel days, making progress to their destination, finding discoveries, and dealing with every obstacle that comes in their way. At the start of each day, the GM will draw from the **Event Deck** for the current Leg to determine the day's weather and any major events, such as roaming spirits or other travelers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom there, the GM will lay out the days' Stakes, and the players will make their Travel Roll, play through the **Menace Deck** (with increased effect if not uncovered) and anything uncovered from the **Exploration Deck**, then make camp for the night, rest, and prepare for the next day. Characters continue to make Travel Rolls until they have accumulated enough travel progress to fill the Clock, which indicates that they'll reach their goal on that day of travel. From there, the game plays as normal, with players overcoming the obstacles required to accomplish their goal or simply resting in a town to prepare for the next phase of travel. Once players reach their final goal and accomplish (or fail to accomplish) their task, the process begins again with the return journey to make it back home.\n&nbsp;\nThe _Menace Deck_ represents issues the party can run into while traveling; some severe, and some quite mundane. Typically, for a relatively safe area, there should be one card per two characters, but as the area becomes more dangerous this increases. In addition to the dangers caused by the region, characters will add cards to the _Menace Deck_ in some situations:\n* If a character has at least half their _Health Bar_ filled, add a _Minor Mishap_ to the _Menace Deck_. When drawn, it will always include them.\n* If a character has at least half their _Health Bar_ filled with _Fatigue_ or _Wounds_, add a _Mishap_ to the _Menace Deck_. When drawn, it will always include them.\n&nbsp;\n\n### The Travel Roll\nEach day when the party attempts to make progress to their destination they should make a Travel Roll, which is a specialized Skill Challenge. In general, characters don't get bonus dice for a travel roll except for abilities that specifically grant them. Most bonus dice will be granted by either knowledge of the route, such as experience or a detailed map, or a Talent that is granting a situational bonus.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLike any Skill Challenge, the GM will first lay out the stakes, many of which are standardized for the Travel Roll, and players must decide if they are being **Bold** or **Cautious** in their travel. In almost every case, there will be one Automatic Stake, **Speed**, which grants a single segment on the progress clock_. In general, all characters make their Travel roll separately, although some Stakes may benefit the whole party or may be offset by a single character. In these cases, provide an additional stakes sheet that only has the **Dangers** and **Augments** for the whole party to simplify tracking whether those have been dealt with.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile traveling, the following are common Stakes that the GM might use:\n\n&nbsp;\n**Dangers:**\n* **Affliction:** In a dangerous areas with odd weather or terrain **Fatigue** or other afflictions might be a danger, although appropriate equipment may automatically remove those dangers automatically.\n* **Delay:** In areas where navigation is difficult this Danger removes a segment from the Clock for the current Leg, after adding any **Speed** from the current one. A single character can offset this **Danger** for the whole party.\n* **Expense:** In areas of extreme heat, characters must mark off a day of water of gain **Thirst**. Other, more exotic climates might require a different resource to navigate, such as antidotes in a toxic swamp.\n* **Fatigue:** In particularly rough terrain characters might risk additional **Fatigue**.\n* **Indiscretion:** This stake is usually present, and represents the party leaving a trail. A single character can offset this **Danger** for the whole party.\n* **Menace:** Any dice placed on this **Danger** can be spent to see a card in the **Menace Deck**. This represents characters scouting out dangers and finding risks before they happen. Sometimes this may allow the party to completely avoid a hazard but, more often, it will provide significant advantage when dealing with the problem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Augments:**\n* **Advantage:** You find a good site to camp for the night, lowering the burden for what equipment is required to get a sufficient rest.\n* **Efficacy:** Choose a single Job to work on during this travel. Any die placed on this Job increase the effect. Many Talents provide additional jobs, but common ones are below:\n    * **Aid:** You may give any die spent on this to other characters, who may immediately roll them and spend them on **Dangers**/**Augments** as appropriate.\n    * **Chart:** Mark one segment on the Route Mastery Clock for this route. Only one character may choose this option per day, and only one segment may be placed on it.\n    * **Forage:** For each die placed on this roll 2d6 and consult the **Forage Chart**, gaining that result. For each additional die placed on this you may roll again, but may only choose a single result.\n    * **Hunt:** As **Forage**, but instead roll on the **Hunting Chart**. Characters may only select this option if they have some sort of ranged attack suitable for hunting.\n* **Observation:** Each die on this **Augment** allows the party to draw a single card from the **Exploration Deck**, resolving its effect.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen traveling, the total progress marked is the lowest progress that any party member achieved. This means that all characters must play the **Speed** Advantage the same number of times; be flexible with allowing players to rearrange how they spent their dice to make sure nobody gets left behind.\n\n&nbsp;\nWhile traveling, the standards for Equipment providing a bonus are significantly higher. Most relevant Equipment will specify its bonuses, such as automatically removing a Danger related to a specific effect.\n&nbsp;\nFinally, characters may choose to have their spirit _Manifested_ for the majority of the travel day. If they are, they may have Traits or other abilities that allow them to assist the party, but will automatically take one _Fatigue_, with the potential for more if the climate does not suit them.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Making Camp\nAfter a long day of travel, the party will typically make camp. When they do, the party has a chance to decompress, gather themselves, and rest. When resting, each party member can do a single **Camp Action**, and then makes their **Rest Roll**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Camp Actions** are all small things that need to be done around the camp, or can help a character properly recover. Each character can normally do one per Camp Phase. In general, basic tasks such as breaking camp, making a fire, and setting up tents are done without a character using their Camp Action. Common Camp Actions are as follows:\n* **Cook:** Much of the food brought on journeys doesn't requires cooking, but game caught on the trail or other similar foods must be cooked to be safely eaten. This action requires Cooking Tools and a fire.\n* **Cover:** You take the time to hide traces of the camp, which may provide an Advantage.\n* **Forage/Hunt:** As the options during Travel, but treat yourself as having placed 0 die on the effect, causing you to roll twice and take the worse of the two.\n* **Mend:** Choose a piece of Equipment that is missing _Durability_ but not _Destroyed_. If you have the appropriate tools, roll a d6. On a 4+, restore one _Durability_. Only one character can target the same item, and this requires the appropriate tools for working with that material.\n* **Patch:** Mark off a medicine. You or another character roll an additional die on your _Rest Roll_, and may immediately mark one segment on a Wound Clock. A character may only benefit from this once per Camp.\n* **Rest:** Roll an additional die on your _Rest Roll_.\n* **Secure:** You take the time to fortify the camp, which may provide an Advantage.\n* **Vent:** Choose another character; the two of you roleplay a quick scene; afterwards, both of you clear 1 **Stress**. This requires both of your _Camp Actions_.\n* **Channel:** You may only take this action if you have considerable _Source_ for your Spirit. Roll an additional 2 die during your _Rest Roll_ that both must be spent on your _Spirit_.\n* **Pamper:** You spend time with your spirit and taking care of it, whether that be playing with it, styling it, or something similar. Afterwards, you or your spirit clears 1 _Stress_. If you have an appropriate item, repeat the effect.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter finishing their Camp Action, characters will mark off one Water and one Food or take the appropriate conditions, then make a **Rest Roll** to see how well they're able to recover. The **Rest Roll** typically has an automatic Stake of a single **Efficacy**, and often includes the following:\n\n&nbsp;\n**Dangers**\n* **Affliction (Crash):** You and your spirit sleep far too heavily or are otherwise unaware, leaving you unresponsive to any dangers for the night.\n\n&nbsp;\n**Augments**\n* **Efficacy:** Remove a **Fatigue** from your or your Spirit or mark one segment on a Wound Clock.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf characters are unable to get a quality rest either due to not finding a sufficiently safe place to camp or missing essential equipment such as bedrolls or tents they take a 1-2 die penalty on their roll. If conditions are sufficiently poor characters may also gain **Stress**. Characters always roll their **Rest Roll** **Cautiously**, unless they are specifically at a Haven or other similarly safe location.\n\n### Travel Pace\nAll the above rules assume a normal travel pace. Characters may make the following changes to their Travel/Rest for the following effects:\n* **Rest:** Skip the _Travel Roll_ today; you make no progress and remain in your camp. You may make your _Rest Roll_ _Boldly_, automatically benefit from the _Rest_ _Camp Action_ and may do two _Camp Actions_.\n* **Explore:** Lose the automatic **Speed** stake, but roll +1 die on your **Travel Roll**.\n* **Forced March:** Gain an additional automatic **Speed** stake. Take an additional **Fatigue**, and roll -1 die on your **Travel Roll**.\n* **Double Shift:** While Making Camp, you may take an additional Camp Action. You may not do the **Rest** Camp Action tonight. Additionally, you lose the automatic **Efficacy** stake when resting, and roll -1 die.",c="### Creating a Town\n\n### Common Shops\n* Smith\n    * Weaponsmith\n    * Armorsmith\n* Cobbler\n* Carpenter\n    * Bowyer\n    * Fletcher\n* Leatherworker\n* Alchemist\n    * Potionmaster\n    * Demolitionist\n    * Poisoner\n* Herbologist\n    * Potionmaster (also)\n* Brewer\n* Farmer\n* Hunter\n* General Store\n* Enchanter\n\n### Supply\nShattered Spirits lacks currency; instead, it deals with a more abstract system of Supply, which represents items you can trade, general goodwill, and your own ability to produce items. Characters will be given a pool of Supply at character creation, as well as at the end of missions to purchase and replace Equipment. ",u="### Character Equipment\nCharacters need to carry weapons, armor, food, and various other supplies to survive in the Shattered World.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Equipment Slots\nInventory in Shattered Spirits is abstracted away to _Inventory Slots_, or simply _Slots_. Slots are a combination of the size and weight of an object, with heavier and bulkier objects taking up additional _Slots_. As a general rule, an item the size of a large knife or Potion is a single _Slot_, one-handed weapons and tools are 2 _Slots_, and two-handed weapons and equipment are 4 _Slots_.\n\n&nbsp;\nA character's inventory is divided up into their _Worn_ and _Packed_ items. A _Worn_ Item is easily accessible, and can be used in high-pressure or combat situations with no additional risks, while _Packed_ items are in a pack, secured, or otherwise inaccessible and require more effort to access. Some items, like Armor, must be in a _Worn_ slot to gain any benefit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCharacters track _Worn_ and _Packed_ equipment seperately. Characters may carry up to 12 _Slots_ of Packed Equipment, and may carry a variable amount of _Worn_ equipment, which impacts their _Encumbrance_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Encumbrance\nDepending on how many equipment slots, characters will have a Light, Medium, or Heavy Load. Characters with a Light Load gain the _Traveling Light_ and _Unencumbered_ Abilities, while those with a Heavy Load gain _Traveling Heavy_ and _Encumbered_.\n\n&nbsp;\nA character's current _Load_ can also be called as a Condition when making a Skill Challenge; typically, a Medium Load will never cause a penalty or danger, while Light/Heavy loads can be called as a benefit penalty when a character's weight would influence the roll.\n&nbsp;\n\nCharacters with a _Worn_ _Load_ of 5 or less have a _Light_ _Load_, 10 or less have a _Medium_, and 15 or less have a _Heavy_. Characters may not travel with a _Load_ greater than 15.\n\n### Adventuring Supplies",d="In order to help the game run more smoothly, some responsibilities that might be the GMs in a different TTRPG are relegated to the players to help the game flow better. These roles are independent of what the characters are capable of and, while they are not necessary, players should do their best to assist with keeping the game flowing.

In this mode, players roleplay, problem solve, and make decisions. Characters abilities are largely defined by their Archetype and Talents, as well as the types of spiritcraft they have decided to specialize in. When players need to break in to a house, soothe an agitated spirit, or solve a puzzle they will use this style of gameplay.\n\n&nbsp;\nAn important offshoot of Narrative is the **Journey**. Characters in the Shattered World have to travel great distances to find solutions, and the Journey mode is a specialized version of Narrative gameplay specifically for that, abstracting problems and timelines to better fit with extended journeys.\n\n&nbsp;\nNot all problems can be solved without violence and, when that is the case, **Combat** is entered. This is a more tactical gameplay mode, where characters move about an abstracted map, using their equipment, skills, and spiritcraft to accomplish their goals.\n\n&nbsp;\nFinally, we have **Downtime**, an extended period where characters have no pressing goals, no looming timelines, and can simply exist in a space. This tends to flow in and out of Narrative play as characters encounter problems, but is how weeks or months of time in the world can be played in a single session.\n",p="### Basic Rules\nThe following basic rules always hold true:\n1. Round up.\n2. You are not your own ally.\n3. Specific overrides general.\n4. When a '/' separates things read it as 'or'. The user may choose any of the options listed and in any combination.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Rounds in Shattered Spirits\nCombat in Shattered Spirits is split up into _Rounds_, _Phases_, and _Turns_.\n\n&nbsp;\nA _Round_ is a complete cycle of combat, where each _Phase_ is completed.\n\n&nbsp;\nA _Phase_ is a collection of _Turns_ that are all occurring at a similar time within the _Round_.\n\n&nbsp;\nA _Turn_ is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various _Techniques_ to influence the battle.\n\n&nbsp;\nA _Round_ is structured as follows:\n**Respite:** The start of each _Round_. This is not a _Phase_, and no Abilities are used. During Respite, resolve the following in the following order:\n* Lose all your current _Momentum_, clearing 2 _Stun_ for every _Momentum_ lost in this way.\n* Lose all _Guard_ and _Movement_.\n* You may _Recover_ once.\n* Change your current _Stance_, if desired.\n* Choose a _Stance_ for your _Spirit_ then, if the Stance is not _Spiritual Essence_, you may _Manifest_ your Spirit at an appropriate _Source_ (as defined by their size) within their _Manifest Range_. You may always _Manifest_ them at _Melee_ Range regardless of _Source_, but you gain 1 less _Craft Momentum_ this _Round_. They become _Engaged_ with any creatures at said _Source_.\n* You and your Spirit gain _Momentum_, _Movement_, and _Guard_ as outlined by your _Stance_s and other abilities.\n* You draw energy from your surroundings, powering your spiritcraft:\n    * If the current location is not suppressing your Spiritcraft, gain 1 _Craft Momentum_.\n    * If the current location is particularly well-suited for your Spiritcraft, gain 1 _Craft Momentum_.\n    * If you are at a _Place of Power_, gain 1 _Craft Momentum_.\n    * If your _Spirit_ is at a _Place of Power_, gain 1 _Craft Momentum_.\n\n&nbsp;\n**Phase 1-6:** These numbered Phases show the passing of time in combat and are when most action will take place. Each character's _Stance_ has a listed Speed, which is the _Phase_ that character takes their _Turn_ in. Any _Summoned_ Spirits also act at their listed _Speed_. If, for some reason, a character would end up acting in a Phase earlier than 1 or later than 6, they instead gain or lose respective _Momentum_ equal to the difference.\n\n&nbsp; \n**End of Round:** The end of the Round. Many effects resolve in this window.\n\n&nbsp;\nAn individual _Phase_ is divided into _Turns_. Within a _Phase_, all players go, then all enemies for that _Phase_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Turns in Shattered Spirits\nOn **their** _Turn_, a character may do the following:\n* Spend any amount of _Movement_.\n* Use any number of _Abilities_. A given _Ability_ may only be used once per _Turn_ unless it has the _Repeatable_ keyword.\n* Make a single _Attack_. Some _Stances_ remove this limit.\n\n&nbsp;\nAdditionally, on **all** _Turns_ (including their own), creatures may do the following:\n* Use any number of _Reactions_. A given _Reaction_ can only be used once per _Turn_ unless specified otherwise, and only one _Reaction_ may be used against a specific trigger.\n* Use any number of _Gambits_, when applicable.\n\n&nbsp;\nSpirit Turns work differently than player ones. A Spirit's _Stance_ will dictate what it is going to do on its turn. For example, _Skirmisher Spirit_ requires that the Spirit attempt to _Engage_ an enemy, then Attack them. In most cases Spirits may use any abilities that make it safer or easier to accomplish this task, but players must, to the best of their abilities, always attempt to fulfill the objective of their Spirit's Stance. For example, if the Stance dictated that a Spirit needs to get to a location and the only way for the Spirit to get there would create an [_Opening_] and they do not have sufficient _Movement_ to prevent it, the Spirit must create said [_Opening_].\n\n&nbsp;\nA Spirit may always use _Breather_ and _Spiritcraft_, regardless of their current _Stance_. However, they may not use them until completing the normal requirements of their _Stance_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Making Attacks\nAttacks in Shattered Spirits have a chart outlining damage and effects for values from 2-12. To make an Attack, you must first make an _Attack Roll_. Roll 2d6 and reference the chart in the Attack, using the Damage and Status in that row to resolve the Attack. For example, [redo this]. \n\n&nbsp;\n**Advantage and Disadvantage:** Sometimes Attacks will have _Advantage_ or _Disadvantage_. An Attack with either rolls 3d6 instead of the normal 2d6. If the Attack has _Advantage_ the attacker resolves the attack with two dice of their choice (typically the highest), while _Disadvantage_ uses the lowest two rolls. If an Attack has both _Advantage_ and _Disadvantage_ they offset one another at a 1-to-1 rate. If an Attack has multiple instances of _Advantage_/_Disadvantage_ any additional instances are instead converted to a _Bonus_/_Penalty_.\n&nbsp;\n\n**Calculating Damage:** When determining how much damage is dealt to a creature, use the following order:\n1. Determine the base Damage, as defined by the Attack or other effect.\n2. Apply _Weakness_ or _Resistance_.\n3. Add any modifiers from current Status Effects.\n4. Take any inflicted _Stun_.\n5. Apply _Block_.\n6. Apply _Ward_.\n7. Take any remaining Damage to _Stamina_.\n\n**Resolving Attacks:** When resolving the effects of an Attack, deal all Damage prior to resolving any Status. Additionally, the Target of an Attack should be aware of the Damage and Status that would be inflicted prior to using Reactions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Extreme Rolls:** There are a variety of Reactions and other effects that can influence Attack Rolls, such as the Deflect Basic Skill, which reduces an _Attack Roll_ by 1. Whenever these are applied, resolve them using the modified _Attack Roll_. If an _Attack Roll_ ever ends up above a 12 or below a 2, special circumstances occur:\n* <ins>If the Attack Roll is above a 12:</ins> Resolve the Attack using the 12 Result.\n* <ins>If the Attack Roll is below 2:</ins> The Attack Misses.\n\n&nbsp;\n**Range:** Attacks in Shattered Spirits will have a Range of _Self_, _Melee_, or a number between 0 and 3. \n* Self-Range effects either only affect the user. \n* Melee effects may only target creatures you are _Engaged_ with.\n* Other effects may target any creature within that many Arenas of you, with 0 Range allowing you to target within your Arena, and 3 allowing you to attack up to 3 Arenas away.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Resources in Combat\n\n* **Stamina:** A representation of a character's stamina and vitality. When this bar is emptied, the character gains a _Wound_.\n* **Stun:** A representation of a character's ability to defend themself. Characters may choose to lose _Block_ instead of _Stamina_ when they take Damage, up to their _Block_.\n* **Momentum:** \n* **Movement:** A resource representing how mobile a character is, and how much they can move about the battlefield. Characters may always spend _Movement_ in the following ways on their _Turn_:\n    * 1 _Movement_: If not _Engaged_ with a hostile creature, become _Engaged_ with a creature in your _Arena_.\n    * 1 _Movement_: Remove _Engaged_.\n    * 2 _Movement_: If not _Engaged_ with a hostile creature, move to an adjacent _Arena_. This cost is often modified by features of either _Arena_, and can be higher or lower.\n    * 1 _Movement_: If not _Engaged_ with a hostile creature, _Occupy_ _Terrain_ or a _Hazard_. You automatically become _Engaged_ with any other creatures _Occupying_ the same effect.\n    * 1 _Movement_: If not _Engaged_ with a hostile creature, take a specific position within your _Arena_, the effects of which should be resolved with your GM. For example, you might move to block a piece of unattended Equipment, which would require that any creature that wants to grab it become _Engaged_ with you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Arenas and Movement\nCombat in Shattered Spirits doesn't make use of a traditional combat grid; instead, it is abstracted away into Arenas. To help demonstrate these concepts, a complex combat map has been provided as an example.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center\">\n<img :src=\"$map\" style=\"width: 40em; border: 2px solid black;\"/>\n</div>\n\n&nbsp;\nArenas are the basic layout of the combat map, and represent distinct areas in a battlefield, with your typical combat consisting of 6-10 Arenas. Each Arena typically represents a distinct and prominent terrain feature (such as the **Steep Cliffs** or **Underground River** on the above map) or is simply used to demonstrate a large amount of distance (such as splitting the **Cave Entrance** and the **Cave Center**). Characters may spend 1 _Movement_ to move to an adjacent _Arena_.\n\n&nbsp;\n On the above map, the **Cave Entrance**, **Underground River**, **Side Tunnel Entrance**, **Cave Center**, **Steep Cliffs**, **High Ground**, **Egg Storage**, **Narrow Tunnel**, and **Queen's Lair** are the relevant Arenas, each with their own distinct effects, as outlined below.\n\n * The **Cave Entrance** is a simple arena. Characters in this Arena can spend 1 _Movement_ on their _Turn_ to flee the battlefield. Additionally, there are two large Stalagmites that characters can _Occupy_ for _Cover_.\n * The **Cave Center** is also simple, with two large Stalagmites that characters can _Occupy_ for _Cover_. It also has two Stalactites that can be can attacked as if they were in Arena above the center; if they take at least 10 Damage they fall; all creatures in the Arena must make _Negate_ [_Reflex_ 10] taking 12 Damage on a failure or half on a success. Finally, creatures may pay 1 extra _Movement_ (total of 3) to move from the **Cave Center** to the **Side Tunnel Entrance** without Swimming.\n * The **Steep Cliffs** is a sheer wall that divides the elevations of the battlefield. It costs an additional _Movement_ (total of 3) to enter and exit this _Arena_, and creatures in this _Arena_ are treated as _Prone_ for all effects. Creatures with the _Climber_ trait ignore these penalties. Finally, creatures attacking from the **High Ground** may ignore the **Steep Cliffs** when determining range.\n * The **Steep Cliffs** is a sheer wall that divides the elevations of the battlefield. It costs an additional _Movement_ to enter and exit this _Arena_, and requires at least one _Free Hand_. Additionally, while in this _Arena_, characters must use one Hand to maintain their hold, have _Disadvantage_ on all rolls, and Attacks against them have _. Creatures with the _Climber_ trait ignore these penalties. Finally, creatures attacking from the **High Ground** may ignore the **Steep Cliffs** when determining range.\n * Finally, the **High Ground** is an area of the battlefield that overlooks the rest. Creatures on the **High Ground** have a +1 _Bonus_ to attack creatures in lower Arenas, and attacks from lower Arenas have a -1 _Bonus_ against them. Creatures that are Pushed from the **High Ground** to the **Cave Center** or **Cave Entrance** fall _Prone_ and take 6 - _Reflex_ Damage.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n### Hit Points and Wounds\n* <ins>Hit Points (Stamina)</ins> represents a character's ability to defend themselves. While a character has _Stamina_ they are taking little damage; they are narrowly avoiding attacks, shrugging off blows, or otherwise taking superficial damage. When a character loses all their _Stamina_ they roll for _Wounds_, reset their stamina to full, then take any remaining Damage. Characters typically start combat encounters with full _Stamina_.\n* <ins>Vigor</ins> represents a character's fighting spirit and sudden surges of energy in battle, and is typically only gained in combat. Vigor is always lost before _Stamina_. _Vigor_ does not stack; if a character would gain _Vigor_ while they already have it they must choose whether to keep their current amount of _Vigor_ or replace it with the value they would gain.\n* <ins>Stun</ins> is how well a character can defend themselves; while they are taking damage just to Stun, they are deflecting attacks away with minimal harm. \n* <ins>Wounds</ins> occur when a character is _Downed_, and represent significant harm dealt to the character. \n* <ins>Downed</ins> occurs when a creature's _Stamina_ reaches 0. For most NPCs, this means they are immediately _Defeated_. Player characters and more powerful NPCs instead roll for _Wounds_. Characters roll a number of d6s equal to their current number of _Wounds_ (2d6 and keep the lower if 0), then gain a _Wound_ with segments equal to half the result. After gaining _Wounds_ a character is reset to full _Stamina_, then takes any overflow damage. If a character has _Armor_, they may choose to _Sunder_ it to take _Fatigue_ in place of a _Wound_, with each _Sunder_ reducing one _Wound_. In addition, if they used a _Block_ against the triggering effect, they may _Sunder_ a _Wielded_ piece of _Equipment_ as if it was Armor.\n* <ins>Spirit Downed</ins> occurs when a character's spirit's _Stamina_ reaches 0. When a _Spirit_ is _Downed_ that character becomes _Suppressed_ for the remainder of the _Round_ (or _Sealed_ if they are already _Suppressed_). Additionally, the spirit rolls for _Wounds_, using the same rules as a player rolling for _Wounds_. After gaining _Wounds_ the _Spirit_ is reset to full _Stamina_, then takes any overflow damage.\n* <ins>Death</ins>: It is extremely rare for a character to be killed in combat in Shattered Spirits. Characters only die when their entire Strain Meter is full of _Wounds_.\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n### Open and Hidden Information\n**Open Information**: Players should <ins>always</ins> have access to the following information, either openly or by asking the Spirit Master:\n* The victory condition for the current encounter.\n* An approximation of a creature's _Stamina_ to the closest 25%.\n* What _Statuses_ and _Afflictions_ a creature is currently suffering from.\n* When/how any _Hazards_ on the battlefield will trigger, and the approximate consequence for doing so (i.e., 'you will be hit by an attack that might inflict _Shocked_').\n* Once _Plotting_ is complete, what _Phase_ all creatures are acting in.\n&nbsp;\n\n**Almost-Open Information:** Players should learn the following information after damaging a creature or applying an _Affliction_ or _Status_:\n* If any damage they dealt was _Resisted_.\n* The Target's _Block_.\n* How much _Stamina_ that creature has remaining.\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hidden Information:** Players should not know the following information unless a _Technique_ reveals it and, additionally, the Spirit Master should not know the following information about player characters unless an ability reveals it:\n* A creature's exact, current _Stamina_.\n* The creature's current _Stances_, and what benefits they have.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Equipment in Combat\nIn combat, characters' equipment is defined by what they have _Worn_ and what they have _Wielded_.\n&nbsp;\n\n_Worn_ items are anything in a character's _Worn_ slots. A character's _Armor_, any consumable items, and any _Weapons_ stowed on their consumables are common examples of _Worn_ items.\n&nbsp;\n\n_Wielded_ items, on the other hand, are items that characters actively are using, typically by holding it in a hand. One-Handed items require a single hand to _Wield_, while Two-Handed items require both.\n&nbsp;\n\nIf a character does not have an item _Wielded_ in a hand, that hand is considered an _Open Hand_.\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment and Open Hands:** In some cases Equipment must be _Wielded_ in two hands or gets additional benefits when _Wielded_ in such a way. In cases such as this, when a character is _Wielding_ a single piece of Equipment, they may choose on each _Turn_ if they are _Wielding_ it in one or both hands, but may not use it unless it is _Wielded_ in the appropriate number of hands.\n&nbsp;\n\n### Miscellaneous\n* If the Cost of an ability is reduced to less than 0, any remaining reduction may (and should) be used on Enhancements.\n* For _Status_:\n    * When Statuses react with an effect, ignore all _Weakness_/_Resistance_ and similar from said Status when resolving the reaction.\n    * A Statuses reaction may not trigger another of its own Reactions.\n    * If a negatable Status is added to an Attack that already afflicts it use the new DC if it is higher or instead increase the _Negate_ DC by half of the new statuses value For example, if _Push_ [4 _Grit_] was added to an Attack with _Push_ [5 _Grit_], it would instead inflict _Push_ [7  _Grit_].",m=a(6503),f=a(3450),_=i["default"].extend({name:"rules-menu",components:{CustomButton:s.A,StatusCard:f.A,ShowCards:m["default"]},data(){return{selectedTab:"Playing the Game",tabs:["Playing the Game","Narrative","Travel","Equipment","Towns","Combat","Afflictions and Status","Terrain","Player Roles","Glossary"],text:[h,o.A,l,u,c,p,"","",d],statusCategories:["Minor Condition","Status Effect","Condition","Instant Effect"],selectedStatuses:["Minor Condition","Status Effect","Condition","Instant Effect"],selectedStatus:null,selectedTerrain:null}},computed:{statuses:function(){return this.$store.getters.getFilteredStatuses(this.selectedStatuses).sort(((e,t)=>e.Name<t.Name?-1:e.Name>t.Name?1:0))},terrains:function(){return this.$store.getters.getTerrains().sort(((e,t)=>e.Name<t.Name?-1:e.Name>t.Name?1:0))},glossaryItems(){var e=this.$store.getters.getGlossary();e.sort(((e,t)=>e.name.localeCompare(t.name)));var t=new Map;for(var a of e)a.hasOwnProperty("effect")&&(t.has(a.name[0])||t.set(a.name[0],[]),t.get(a.name[0]).push(a));return t}}}),g=_,y=a(1656),b=(0,y.A)(g,n,r,!1,null,"b5cfb7fa",null),v=b.exports},4663:function(e,t){"use strict";t.A="The next choice is the type of weapons that a character will wield. In combat, a character can wield up to two hands worth of weaponry at a time. There are many different weapon types, all with their own perks:\n* **Bladed** weapons such as swords and daggers tend to be faster, and provide a balanced approach between mobility and block. Most bladed weapons inflict _Bleeding_, which can slowly take down a foe over time. Bladed weapons tend to have a higher variance in damage than the other types of weapons and can provide the opportunity for massive damage when attacking at Advantage.\n* **Hafted** weapons such as hammers and axes tend to be slow but powerful weapons that excel at punching through blocks and armor. They can frequently inflict _Exposed_ or _Push_ foes, allowing them to set up powerful combinations with allies. Hafted weapons tend to have a fairly flat damage profile, making them extremely consistent and making _Guard_ Reactions less effective.\n* **Pole** weapons such as spears and pikes boast higher reach and accuracy than other weapon types. Pole weapons tend to inflict _Hobbled_, which limits the mobility of foes, and have various Techniques that allow a skilled Pole user to punish foes that dare enter their reach.\n* **Projectile** weapons such as bows and slings are less accurate than their melee counterparts, but make up for it with extremely high damage and range. As long as a spiritbound is able to catch their foes outside of _Cover_, ranged weapons will deal consistently high damage. With investment in the appropriate _Techniques_ most Ranged weapons can also create dangerous _Hazards_ on the battlefield, punishing immobile foes.\n* **Thrown** weapons are less a category of weapons and more a subset of other weapons. While less accurate than their melee counterparts, _Thrown_ weapons are incredibly fast and allow for a large number of attacks at flexible ranges at the expense of disarming yourself.\n* **Shields** are the least damaging of the weapon types, but enhance a character's ability to _Guard_ attacks. Investing further into shield Disciplines will enhance this capability further and turn a shield-bearer into a mobile fortress capable of defending allies.\n\n&nbsp;\nAmong each of these weapon categories there's a range of different options that provide different tradeoffs between the number of hands they take, their damage, and their speed. Characters may select as many weapons as they wish but must be mindful of the total _Load_ of their gear.

Most concerning, children who complete their Binding awake screaming, with no idea of the cause of their terror.\n&nbsp;\nYou are a Spiritbound of rare skill.
