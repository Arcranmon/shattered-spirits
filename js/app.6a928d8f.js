You are not your own ally.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Rounds in Shattered Spirits\nCombat in Shattered Spirits is split up into _Rounds_, _Phases_, and _Turns_. A _Round_ is a complete cycle of combat, where each _Phase_ is completed. A _Phase_ is a collection of _Turns_ that are all occurring at a similar speed in combat. A _Turn_ is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various _Techniques_ to influence the battle.\n&nbsp;\nA _Round_ is structured as follows:\n**Respite:** The start of each _Round_. This is not a _Phase_, and no Techniques are used. During Respite, resolve the following in the following order:\n* Trigger any 'Respite begins' abilities.\n* Use an [_Armament_] _Stunt_ as if it was your _Turn_, reducing its _Cost_ by 1.\n* You and your spirit set your _Stamina_ to its maximum value.\n* Resolve the effects of Wounds and other persistent afflictions the character has:\n    * For now, gain 1 _Stun_ per _Wound_. [Temporary rule]\n* Resolve any  other effects that occur during _Respite_.\n\n&nbsp; \n**Plotting:** Once Respite is complete, both the _Spirit Master_ and the Players will all determine what _Technique_ they are making use of in the round. Players may select a single _Technique_ to use each _Round_. Players will choose the _Technique_ they wish to use in the Round, then decide which _Speed_ they wish to use it at. What Speeds a _Technique_ may be played at is specified in its stats. When playing a _Technique_ consult the _Speed_ of any _Attacks_ you hope to make as a part of it; that may impact the _Speed_ you wish to play it at! (See _Speed Penalty_) \n\n&nbsp; \n\nPlayers and enemies simultaneously select all _Techniques_. Players and the GM should (to the best of their ability) select Techniques independent of one another, but players are free to (and encouraged to!) strategize among themselves when selecting Techniques. This ends when all players and enemies have decided their _Techniques_ for the Round. Players and most enemies choose a single Technique, but more advanced enemies may be able to use multiple in a single round.\n\n&nbsp; \nAfter all _Techniques_ are selected, the _Speed_ of the _Techniques_ are revealed (but not the effect!) and the round begins!\n\n&nbsp;\n**Phase 1-4:** These numbered Phases are where the bulk of _Techniques_ will be resolved. _Phases_ are resolved in order, 1-4, with Phase 1 representing the fastest _Techniques_ and Phase 4 representing the slowest. During these _Phases_ characters may also resolve _Maneuvers_. Characters may use as many abilities as they wish per Phase, but only one may be a Technique or Action. At the end of _Phase_ 4 any effects that trigger at the end of a _Phase_ (such as a _Charged Attack_) immediately end unless otherwise specified.\n\n&nbsp; \n**End of Round:** The end of the Round. Many _Techniques_ and _Hazard_ effects resolve in this window. \n\n&nbsp;\nAn individual _Phase_ is divided into _Turns_, where players and enemies alternate using _Techniques_ and taking _Actions_. Within a _Phase_, players and enemies will alternate who acts. Typically, players get to act first in the first Phase of combat; after that, the first to act in the next _Phase_ is always the opposite of whatever group finished the current _Phase_. For example, if a player acts last in Phase 2, an enemy gets to act first in Phase 3.\n&nbsp;\nWhenever it is the player's opportunity to act in a _Phase_ they may choose to take an _Action_ or resolve the _Technique_ they selected for this phase. If they pass, their opponents get the same opportunity, with the _Turns_ alternating as normal. If both sides pass, continue to the next _Phase_.\n&nbsp;\nAfter a _Technique_ is selected during the Plotting Phase a character is committing to using that _Technique_. However, if a character finds they no longer wish to use a _Technique_ selected in the Plotting Phase, they may choose to instead use the _Improvise_ _Technique_.\n&nbsp;\nPlayer characters may use an _Action_ in every _Phase_ except the one they use a _Technique_, for a total of 3 _Actions_ and 1 _Technique_ per _Round_.\n&nbsp;\nIf the _Speed_ of a _Technique_ is modified to be less than 1, instead add _Priority_ and resolve it in _Phase_ 1. If it is modified to be greater than 4, add _Stall_ and resolve it in _Phase_ 4. Use the modified _Speed_ for all effects that depend on the _Speed_ of the ability.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Turns in Shattered Spirits\nOn **their** _Turn_, a character may do the following:\n* Resolve the _Technique_ or _Action_ they're using.\n* Use any number of _Stunts_. A given _Stunt_ may only be used once per _Turn_ unless it has the _Repeatable_ keyword.\n&nbsp;\n\nAdditionally, on **all** _Turns_ (including their own), creatures may do the following:\n* Use any number of _Reactions_. A given _Reaction_ can only be used once per _Turn_ unless specified otherwise, and only one _Reaction_ may be used against a specific trigger.\n* Use any number of _Gambits_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Making Attacks\nThroughout Shattered Spirits you will see Techniques that have a _Profile_, or a chart outlining damage and effects for values from 2-12. These are referred to as Attacks, and they are typically used to damage or impair hostile creatures. To make an Attack, you must first make an _Attack Roll_. Roll 2d6 and reference the _Profile_ in the Attack, using the Damage and Status in that row to resolve the Attack. For example, if a creature were to use the _Chip Shot_ Attack from the Basic Mountain Arts and rolled an 8, they would deal 6 Damage (seen in the Damage column) and inflict _Exposed_ 1 (seen in the Status column) on the foe. \n\n&nbsp;\n**Advantage and Disadvantage:** Sometimes Attacks will have _Advantage_ or _Disadvantage_. An Attack with either rolls 3d6 instead of the normal 2d6. If the Attack has _Advantage_ it uses the highest two rolls to resolve the Attack, while _Disadvantage_ uses the lowest two rolls. If an Attack has both _Advantage_ and _Disadvantage_ they offset one another at a 1-to-1 rate. If an Attack has multiple instances of _Advantage_/_Disadvantage_ any additional instances are instead converted to a _Bonus_/_Penalty_.\n&nbsp;\n\n**Calculating Damage:** When determining how much damage is dealt to a creature, use the following order:\n1. Determine the base Damage, as defined by the Chart, Technique, or other Effect.\n2. Add any modifiers from the Technique, Maneuvers, or Afflictions, such as _Impaired_ or _Exposed_.\n3. Apply _Glancing_.\n4. Apply _Vulnerable_.\n5. Apply _Guard_.\n\n**Resolving Attacks:** When resolving the effects of an Attack, deal all Damage prior to resolving any Status. Additionally, the Target of an Attack should be aware of the Damage and Status that would be inflicted prior to using Reactions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Extreme Rolls:** There are a variety of Reactions and other effects that can influence Attack Rolls, such as the Deflect Basic Skill, which reduces an _Attack Roll_ by 1. Whenever these are applied, resolve them using the modified _Attack Roll_. If an _Attack Roll_ ever ends up above a 12 or below a 2, special circumstances occur:\n* <ins>If the Attack Roll is above a 12:</ins> Resolve the Attack using the 12 Result. Deal an additional 2 Damage (if any) and add _Dazed_ 1.\n* <ins>If the Attack Roll is below 2:</ins> The Attack Misses.\n\n&nbsp;\n**Range:** Attacks in Shattered Spirits will have a Range of _Self_, _Melee_, and _Short_, _Medium_, and _Long Range_. \n* Self-Range effects either only affect the user, or are centered on them. \n* Melee effects may only target within your Position.\n* Short-Range effects may target within your Arena that are not at your _Position_.\n* Reach effects my target any creature within your Arena.\n* Medium-Range effects may target within an adjacent Arena.\n* Long-Range effects may target within Arenas that are two Paths away.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n### Movement and the Combat map\nThe Combat Map in Shattered Spirits is comprised of _Arenas_, _Paths_, and _Positions_.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe primary unit of this is the _Arena_, which are distinct locations that combat takes place in. Any number of characters can be in an _Arena_ at the same time.\n\n&nbsp;\nConnecting _Arenas_ are _Paths_, which show the ways that Arenas are connected to one another. These typically list a simple _Move_ cost to go from one to another, but may have more complicated conditions such as Terrain effects.\n\n&nbsp;\n_Positions_ represent where characters are in a given _Arena_. Characters at the same _Position_ are all within Melee range of one another and may _Occupy_ _Features_ at said _Position_.\n\n&nbsp;\nCharacters have a number of Moves, which they may spend in combat. When a character uses a Technique or takes their Action they will be given a set number of Moves for that ability but may also spend Moves from their Move Pool. \n\n&nbsp;\nCharacters may always spend Moves to do one of the following:\n* Move to a different Arena, paying the listed Move cost for the Path. This creates an _Opening_.\n* Spend 1 _Move_ to join a _Position_ or establish a new one. If there is an unoccupied _Feature_ at said _Position_, the creature may _Occupy_ it. This creates an _Opening_.\n* Spend 1 _Move_ to _Occupy_ a _Feature_ at your current _Position_.\n\n&nbsp;\n_Techniques_ and Actions may provide their own pool of Movement for the character to use that is lost at the end of the _Turn_. All other _Moves_ a character makes must come from their Move pool, which is determined based on their _Load_:\n* Characters with a _Load_ less than or equal to their _Standard Load_ have a _Move_ of 3 and _Jump_ of 1.\n* Characters with a _Load_ less than or equal to double their _Standard Load_ have a _Move_ of 2 and _Jump_ of 0.\n* Characters with a _Load_ less than or equal to triple their _Standard Load_ have a _Move_ of 1 and _Jump_ of 0.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Health and Wounds\n* <ins>Health</ins> represents a character's ability to defend themselves. While a character has _Health_ they are taking little damage; they are narrowly avoiding attacks, shrugging off blows, or otherwise taking superficial damage. When a character loses all their _Health_ they roll for _Wounds_, then increment their _Downed_ tracker. Characters typically start combat encounters with full _Health_.\n* <ins>Vigor</ins> represents a character's fighting spirit and sudden surges of energy in battle, and is typically only gained in combat. Vigor is always lost before _Health_. _Vigor_ does not stack; if a character would gain _Vigor_ while they already have it they must choose whether to keep their current amount of _Vigor_ or replace it with the value they would gain.\n* <ins>Stun</ins> is a character's mental and physical state, as well as their composure. Characters start at 0 _Stun_. When a character's total _Stun_ is equal to or greater than their maximum _Stun_ amount they immediately become _Stunned_ and reset their _Stun_ to 0.\n* <ins>Wounds</ins> occur when a character is _Downed_. \n* <ins>Downed</ins> occurs when a creature's _Health_ reaches 0. For most NPCs, this means they are immediately _Defeated_. Player characters and more powerful NPCs instead roll for _Wounds_, which is done by rolling a number of d6s based on the number of times they have been _Downed_ prior to this. After gaining _Wounds_ a character is reset to full _Health_.\n    * [redo]\n* <ins>Spirit Downed</ins> occurs when a character's spirit's _Health_ reaches 0. When a _Spirit_ is _Downed_ that character becomes _Suppressed_ for the remainder of the _Round_ (or _Sealed_ if they are already _Suppressed_). Additionally, the spirit marks one against their _Spirit Track_. At the start of the next_Phase_ the spirit is reset to full _Health_.\n* <ins>Death</ins>: It is extremely rare for a character to be killed in combat in Shattered Spirits. Characters only die when their entire Strain Meter is full of _Wounds_.\n&nbsp;  \n\n### Open and Hidden Information\n**Open Information**: Players should <ins>always</ins> have access to the following information, either openly or by asking the Spirit Master:\n* The victory condition for the current encounter.\n* An approximation of a creature's _Health_ to the closest 25%.\n* What _Statuses_ and _Afflictions_ a creature is currently suffering from.\n* When/how any _Hazards_ on the battlefield will trigger, and the approximate consequence for doing so (i.e., 'you will be hit by an attack that might inflict _Shocked_').\n* Once _Plotting_ is complete, what _Phase_ all creatures are acting in.\n&nbsp;\n\n**Almost-Open Information:** Players should learn the following information after damaging a creature or applying an _Affliction_ or _Status_:\n* If any damage they dealt was _Resisted_.\n* The Target's _Guard_.\n* How much _Stamina_ that creature has remaining.\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hidden Information:** Players should not know the following information unless a _Technique_ reveals it and, additionally, the Spirit Master should not know the following information about player characters unless an ability reveals it:\n* What _Techniques_ a creature is using (before the creature resolves said _Techniques_).\n* A creature's exact, current _Health_.\n* The creature's current _Stances_, and what benefits they have.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Equipment in Combat\nIn combat, characters' equipment is defined by what they have _Equipped_ and what they have _Wielded_.\n&nbsp;\n\n_Equipped_ items are simply anything that a character is wearing. If it is in their inventory, it is typically considered _Equipped_. A character's _Armor_, any consumable items, and any _Weapons_ stowed on their belt are common examples of _Equipped_ items.\n&nbsp;\n\n_Wielded_ items, on the other hand, are items that characters actively are using, typically by holding it in a hand. One-Handed items require a single hand to _Wield_, while Two-Handed items require both.\n&nbsp;\n\nIf a character does not have an item _Wielded_ in a hand, that hand is considered an _Open Hand_.\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment and Open Hands:** In some cases Equipment must be _Wielded_ in two hands or gets additional benefits when _Wielded_ in such a way. In cases such as this, when a character is _Wielding_ a single piece of Equipment, they may choose on each _Turn_ if they are _Wielding_ it in one or both hands, but may not use it unless it is _Wielded_ in the appropriate number of hands.\n&nbsp;\n\n### Miscellaneous\n* If the Cost of an ability is reduced to less than 0, any remaining reduction may be used on Boosts.\n* For _Status_:\n    * When Statuses react with an effect, ignore all _Weakness_/_Resistance_ and similar from said Status when resolving the reaction.\n    * A Statuses reaction may not trigger another of its own Reactions.\n    * If a negatable Status is added to an Attack that already afflicts it use the new DC if it is higher or instead increase the _Negate_ DC by half of the new statuses value For example, if _Push_ [4 _Grit_] was added to an Attack with _Push_ [5 _Grit_], it would instead inflict _Push_ [7  _Grit_].",W=(a(4847),a(7002)),I=i["default"].extend({name:"combat-rules",computed:{combatText(){return G}}}),F=I,B=(0,d.A)(F,H,D,!1,null,"2fa15119",null),j=B.exports,O=function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;e._self._setupProxy;return t("div",{staticStyle:{padding:"1em"}},[t("h2",[e._v("Combat Primer")]),t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.combatText}})],1)},E=[],z="Combat in Shattered Spirits is a mix of carefully planned abilities and sudden, spur-of-the-moment decision making. Every _Round_ begins with a _Respite_, where combatants gain resources, reset their defenses, and, depending on their abilities, may be able to accomplish some minor actions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter _Respite_ is complete, _Plotting_ begins. All combatants decide which of their _Techniques_ they are going to use for the _Round_, as well as what _Phase_ (a value ranging from 1-4) it will be played in. Faster _Techniques_ tend to have a more minimal impact, while slower _Techniques_ will have more power, but run the risk of being invalidated by how the battlefield shifts over time. Players should collaborate when picking _Techniques_ and can effectively use this period to plan their approach for the _Round_. _Techniques_ all specify what _Phases_ it can be played at, as outlined by their Speed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce all combatants have selected their _Techniques_ and when they will be played it becomes public knowledge what creature is using a _Technique_ in what _Phase_, but not what _Technique_ is being used. Players (as well as enemies!) can use this information to adapt their plans accordingly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point the round of combat begins, starting in _Phase_ 1. Players and enemies alternate acting, resolving _Techniques_ and other abilities until a _Phase_ is complete and the next begins. Once _Phase_ 4 is over _Respite_ starts and the next _Round_ begins!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAside from their _Technique_, players can also contribute to the battle using _Actions_. Characters may use an _Action_ in every _Phase_ that they are not using their _Technique_. Some _Actions_, such as _Fight_, are a simple way to deal more damage, while _Reposition_ is an excellent way to maneuver around the battlefield.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBeyond _Actions_ and _Techniques_, characters have a host of other abilities they can use in battle:\n* _Attacks_ are abilities that focus on defeating or debuffing foes. These can only be used when specifically outlined (such as by a _Technique_ or _Stunt_), but may be used at any Speed! Be forewarned though; using an Attack in a _Phase_ lower than it's _Speed_ imposes a steep penalty on its accuracy. If using a _Technique_ that allows you to make Attacks, consider playing it in a _Phase_ that will mitigate those  penalties! Attacks are split into _Light_, _Balanced_, and _Heavy_ Attacks. Each tier of Attack is more effective than the last, but tends to cost more _Momentum_ to use.\n* _Stunts_ are special abilities that characters can use on their _Turn_. These are abilities like _Sprint_, which allows you to move further, or _Leap_ which can let you jump over dangerous features.\n* _Reactions_ are abilities that can be used at any time. These are powerful defensive abilities like _Defend_, as well as things that allow you to punish foes, such as _Opportunity Attack_.\n* _Gambits_ are specialized abilities that enhance Attacks. Whenever a character rolls doubles or rolls a _Critical Hit_ they may apply a _Gambit_, or apply two if both conditions are true.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn combat there are a few main resources that a character must manage:\n* _Momentum_ is a character's primary mechanism for doing more in combat. Most _Stunts_, _Reactions_, _Gambits_, and many Attacks cost _Momentum_. _Momentum_ is gained from your _Stances_ during _Respite_, by abilities such as _Focus_, and by missing Attacks.\n* _Movement_ is used by characters to traverse the battlefield and fuel high-mobility abilities. Characters have a small pool of _Movement_ that they may spend whenever it is their _Turn_. Additionally, many _Techniques_ and _Actions_ will provide additional _Movement_ that a character may use.\n* _Stamina_ is a character's primary defensive resource, which can be spent to fuel defensive Reactions and ensure a character's survival.\n* _Health_ is a measure of a character's current Health in combat. If a character's _Health_ hits 0 they aren't immediately defeated; instead, they gain _Wounds_ which make continuing combat more difficult.\n* _Vigor_ is a pool of pseudo-Health that is always lost prior to _Health_. _Vigor_ never stacks; a character must either gain nothing or replace their current value when they would gain _Vigor_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShattered Spirits uses a zone-based combat system where rather than a battlemap consisting of hexes or spaces there are simply different areas, called Arenas, where combatants can be. Each _Arena_ represents a distinct environment in the battlefield with its own terrain and hazards.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWithin each _Arena_ are a number of _Positions_, which represent the approximate positioning of characters and objects within said _Arena_. Most _Arenas_ can have any number of _Positions_, and it typically takes only a single _Movement_ to move between _Positions_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe avenues between _Arenas_ are called _Paths_ and represent the distance and hazards in between different _Arenas_. It always takes at least one _Movement_ to move between _Arenas_, although it typically costs more due to environmental effects.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRange is based on the number of _Arenas_. _Melee_ effects can be used at your _Position_, while _Short_ Range may target anything in your _Arena_ that is not at your _Position_. _Reach_ Range may target any creature within your _Arena_. _Medium_ Range may target within an adjacent _Arena_, and _Long_ Range may target two _Arenas_ away. Effects may ONLY use their listed Range; a _Short_ Range effect could not target something at your _Position_, for example.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinally, characters need to carefully manage their _Sources_ and ensure that they don't fall victim to a condition that makes it difficult to use their spirit powers! \n* Flamebound act as _Suppressed_ when _Soaked_ or at a _Position_ with _Water_ _Terrain_, and _Sealed_ when _Swimming_ in Water.\n* Earthbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user has no _Source_ at their _Position_, and _Sealed_ when there is no _Source_ in their _Arena_ or the user is _Flying_.\n* Waterbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user is _Alight_, and _Sealed_ if there is no _Source_ in any adjacent _Area_.\n* Windbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user is underground and _Sealed_ when the user is fully encased in _Earth_, such as when _Restrained_ by an _Earth_ Ability.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCombat typically continues until the players succeed or fail their objective for the battle. This can be something as simple as defeating all their enemies or more complicated, such as holding specific objectives on the battlefield for a set duration. Your Spirit Master will explain how to win at the beginning of combat, as well as answer any rules questions that you may have during the battle. Good luck, and may you and your spirit find success on the battlefield!\n\n",Y=i["default"].extend({name:"combat-primer",computed:{combatText(){return z}}}),q=Y,N=(0,d.A)(q,O,E,!1,null,"73fce0af",null),L=N.exports,V=function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;e._self._setupProxy;return t("div",{staticClass:"background"},[t("h2",[e._v("Afflictions and Status")]),e.isMobile?t("span",[t("v-row",{staticStyle:{"margin-left":"0.5em","margin-right":"0.5em"},attrs:{align:"center"}},[t("v-col",{attrs:{cols:"12"}},[t("v-select",{attrs:{items:e.statusCategories,attach:"",label:"Status Categories",multiple:"",filled:"",outlined:""},model:{value:e.selectedStatuses,callback:function(t){e.selectedStatuses=t},expression:"selectedStatuses"}})],1)],1),t("br"),t("v-select",{staticStyle:{"margin-left":"0.5em","margin-right":"0.5em"},attrs:{items:e.statuses,"item-text":"Name","return-object":"",attach:"",label:"Selected Status",filled:"",outlined:""},model:{value:e.selectedStatus,callback:function(t){e.selectedStatus=t},expression:"selectedStatus"}}),t("div",[null!=e.selectedStatus?t("status-card",{staticStyle:{width:"40em","margin-left":"auto","margin-right":"auto"},attrs:{status:e.selectedStatus}}):e._e()],1)],1):t("span",[t("v-row",{staticStyle:{"margin-left":"0.5em","margin-right":"0.5em"},attrs:{align:"center"}},[t("v-col",{attrs:{cols:"6"}},[t("v-select",{attrs:{items:e.statusCategories,attach:"",label:"Status Categories",multiple:"",filled:"",outlined:""},model:{value:e.selectedStatuses,callback:function(t){e.selectedStatuses=t},expression:"selectedStatuses"}})],1)],1),t("v-row",{staticClass:"background--color"},[t("v-col",{staticClass:"sidebar",attrs:{cols:"auto"}},[t("v-btn-toggle",{attrs:{borderless:"","overflow-auto":""}},e._l(e.statuses,(function(a){return t("div",{key:a,staticStyle:{width:"100%"}},[t("v-btn",{staticClass:"button--style",attrs:{depressed:"",tile:"",block:""},on:{click:function(t){e.selectedStatus=a}}},[t("img",{staticClass:"image--icon-size",attrs:{src:a.Icon}}),e._v(e._s(a.Name)+" ")])],1)})),0)],1),t("v-col",[null!=e.selectedStatus?t("status-card",{key:e.selectedStatus.Name,staticStyle:{width:"40em"},attrs:{status:e.selectedStatus}}):e._e()],1)],1)],1)])},$=[],X=a(3459),J=i["default"].extend({name:"afflictions-and-status",components:{StatusCard:X.A},data(){return{statusCategories:["Status Effect","Affliction","Elemental Affliction","Mental Affliction","Instant Effect"],selectedStatuses:["Status Effect","Affliction","Elemental Affliction","Mental Affliction","Instant Effect"],selectedStatus:null}},computed:{statuses:function(){return this.$store.getters.getFilteredStatuses(this.selectedStatuses).sort(((e,t)=>e.Name<t.Name?-1:e.Name>t.Name?1:0))}}}),U=J,K=(0,d.A)(U,V,$,!1,null,"19222623",null),Q=K.exports,Z=function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;e._self._setupProxy;return t("div",{staticStyle:{padding:"1em"}},[t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingDisciplines}}),t("div",{class:e.skillBox},[t("stance-card",{attrs:{stance:e.$store.getters.getStance("Example Stance")}})],1),t("br"),t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingStances}}),t("br"),t("div",{class:e.skillBox},[t("tech-card",{attrs:{tech:e.$store.getters.getTechnique("Example Technique")}})],1),t("br"),t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingTechniques}}),t("div",{class:e.skillBox},[t("chart-table",{staticStyle:{"font-size":"smaller"},attrs:{chart:e.$store.getters.getTechnique("Example Technique").Chart}})],1),t("br"),t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingAttackProfiles}}),t("div",{class:e.skillBox},[t("maneuver-card",{staticStyle:{"font-size":"smaller"},attrs:{maneuver:e.$store.getters.getManeuver("Example Maneuver")}})],1),t("br"),t("display-tooltip-text",{attrs:{string:e.readingManeuvers}})],1)},ee=[],te="\n A Profile is what is used to determine the effectiveness of an attack. It is comprised of two or three columns: _Hit_,  Damage, and Status.\n* **Hit** shows whether an Attack is a _Miss_,  _Graze_,  _Hit_,  or _Crit_. This column will always show 2-12, with a color code to show the effectiveness. When you Attack, simply consult the _Hit_ column and resolve the Attack using that row.\n    * Red means a _Miss_ which, in general, means that no effect happens with the attack.\n    * Yellow means a _Graze_, which is typically a minor effect that rarely inflicts Status.\n    * Green means a _Hit_, representing a solid hit, which deals a good amount of damage and typically inflicts Status.\n    * Purple means a _Crit_, representing a very effective hit. These tend to deal a great deal of damage and almost always inflict Status. \n* **Damage** shows how much damage is dealt by the attack. This is present for all Strikes and some Maneuvers.\n* **Status** shows what status conditions this attack may afflict. These will always follow the format Condition X (Y Defense). The Condition is the actual status effect being afflicted, such as Hobbled. X is present if this Technique afflicts a Condition, and designates the size of the Token. Sometimes this will be followed by a x2 or x3, indicating that it applies multiple Tokens of that size. Finally, the Y Defense section designates what must be paid to Negate this status effect. When this Technique is used, the Target may pay Y of the listed Defense to not gain the status effect. Some Techniques will have effects that say +(Defensive Token). In these cases, the attacker gains the Token, not the defender.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Reading Maneuvers",ae="### Reading Disciplines\nDisciplines are where much of a characters combat abilities come from and are how characters gain access to Stances, Techniques, and Maneuvers.\n&nbsp;\nDisciplines are separated into several Tiers. A character may only take a higher Tier of a Discipline if they have the previous Tier, and may not select Tier III Disciplines until [not Level 1].\n&nbsp;\nDisciplines are labeled with a role that generally describes the types of abilities provided. The first listed role is typically a common thread throughout most Techniques and Maneuvers and is the main purpose of the Stance, while the second role may only appear in some. The different roles are as follows:\n\n* **Artillery** Disciplines specialize in long-range and prefer to keep their distance from foes. Artillery Disciplines are typically capable of high damage at long ranges but can struggle with Cover and other obstructions.\n* **Controller** Disciplines specialize in applying status afflictions to foes and moving them about the battlefield, limiting their effectiveness and making foes easier targets for allies.\n* **Courier** Disciplines tend to have high movement among their abilities, as well as movement options that make it far easier to navigate terrain and enemy positions.\n* **Defender** Disciplines specialize in drawing fire from enemies and keeping them nearby, controlling enemies by limiting their targeting options.\n* **Shaper** Disciplines heavily manipulate Terrain and Features, either by creating them or removing them and can easily change the layout of the battlefield.\n* **Striker** Disciplines specialize in close-range combat, and often prioritize melee attacks over all else. Striker Disciplines are typically capable of the greatest damage in the system.\n* **Supporter** Disciplines are often able to provide allies with Defensive Tokens or Momentum, as well as repositioning them, removing harmful effects, or otherwise assisting allies.\n* **Survivor** Disciplines tend to provide powerful Resists that allow characters to mitigate damage and other effects to remain in the battle longer.\n\n&nbsp;\nWhen selecting Disciplines, be mindful of any common prerequisites among their Techniques; if you select a Discipline that requires a Bladed Weapon and aren't carrying one, it isn't going to be of much use! Additionally, if you intend to heavily focus on Defender Disciplines, selecting some Survivor Disciplines will be essential to keeping yourself in the battle.\n&nbsp;\n### Reading Stances",ne="**Maneuvers** are ways that creatures can improve a Technique and increase its power. There are several types of **Maneuvers**, which are categorized based on how often they can be used and the common triggers for that Maneuver.\n\n&nbsp;\n* **Stratagems** are Maneuvers that characters use when they play a Technique. These Maneuvers typically enhance the power of a Technique while manipulating its Speed in some way. Characters may apply as many Stratagems as they wish to a single Technique.\n* **Stunts** are Maneuvers that characters can use on their own Turn. A character may use as many Stuntsas they wish in a given Turn but may only use a given Stunt once unless it has the _Repeatable_ keyword.\n* **Resists** are Maneuvers used in response to being assaulted in some way, typically by dodging, blocking, or countering. Characters may only use a single Resist per Turn.\n* **Reactions** are Maneuvers used in response to a specific trigger. They can be used at any point, but only once in response to a specific trigger.\n* **Gambits** are specialized ways to enhance an Attack that may be applied when the Attack is made. Any number of Gambits may be applied to a specific Attack, but only one with the _Edge_ keyword.\n* **Flourishes** are Maneuvers used at the completion of an Attack. Only one Flourish may be used each Turn.\n* **Punishes** are specialized Maneuvers used in response to a specific trigger such as a foe moving. A character may use only a single Punish each Turn.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe header of a Maneuver will simply contain its name, a brief description, and any applicable Keywords that the Reaction has. One particular keyword of note is _Flexible_; typically, Maneuvers must be applied at the same time that a Technique is played. For _Flexible_ Techniques, the Maneuver may be applied when the Technique is used.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe remainder of the Maneuver is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Reaction; they are simply here for a comprehensive definition.\n* **Cost** is what must be paid when a Maneuver is used. If the cost cannot be paid, the Maneuver may not be used.\n* **Trigger** defines what must occur to use a Maneuver. Common examples are 'You are attacked' or 'A _Phase_ begins.'\n* **Requirements** are any condition that must be true to use a Maneuver. Typically, this just requires that you are in a particular _Stance_.\n* **Weapon** is a somewhat specialized requirement; if this Maneuver references _Weapon Attacks_ they must be made using the Weapon type specified by this field.\n* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Maneuver.\n* **Special** is the secondary effect of the Maneuver, that is typically either conditional or more specific than the primary effect.\n* **Boost** is an additional Cost that can be paid when the Technique this Maneuver has been applied to is used. This additional cost is purely optional, but can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of an Maneuver.\n",ie="**Stances** represent a character's bearing in combat and tend to allow them to specialize in a specific approach in combat. A character may have one Martial Stance and one Spirit Stance active at the same time. Stances provide an easy way for character to gain combat resources, and tend to empower a specific type of action or playstyle.\n&nbsp;\nThe header of a Stance is fairly sparse; it will only contain the name of the Stance and a brief description of how it functions.\n&nbsp;\nThe meat of a Stance is contained in its body. The following fields can be typically found in a Stance:\n* **Requirements:** Most Martial Stances have this field. If a Stance has Requirements, you do not get any benefits from this Stance unless you fulfill them. You can still be using the Stance, but will not get any bonuses or resources from it. For example, if a Stance requires _Wielding_ a Bladed Weapon, if the character is _Disarmed_ of their _Bladed_ Weapon they lose all bonuses provided by said Stance.\n* **respite:** This field is present on most Stances, and indicates a way that combat resources can be easily obtained. Typically, the respite field will contain a condition that, if fulfilled, will provide the spiritbound with Momentum or some other combat resource.\n* **Refresh:** While the respite field indicates a resource that must be earned, the Refresh field indicates what combat resources a character simply gains for free at the Refresh Phase in combat. These tend to be defensive resources such as Tough and Reflex, but can occasionally include other resources or actions, such as creating Terrain during Refresh.\n* **Effect:** This field indicates a passive bonus or additional options available to the character while in this Stance. Reduced Cost or increased effectiveness for certain actions are common, but some Stances have more esoteric bonuses.\n* **Special:** This field is similar to Effect, but is usually a secondary bonus or one that breaks a typical rule.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Reading Techniques",re='**Techniques** are every attack, move, and defensive action characters take on their _Turn_ in combat. In aggregate, Techniques represent your character\'s combat capabilities.\n&nbsp;\nThe header of a Technique card contains a great deal of information. First is the name of the Technique, followed by a brief description.\n&nbsp;\nThe next line has the <ins>Speed</ins> of the Technique, which will either correspond with a Phase (such as Instinctive or 1-6) or be listed as a Reaction. This is followed by the <ins>Range</ins> of a Technique, which will be Melee (meaning it can only target adjacent foes), Self (meaning it targets the creature using it), or be listed as a numeric value. If the Technique effects an <ins>Area</ins> that is listed next (see the Areas page for more information about the different areas of effect). Finally, the <ins>AP</ins> of the Technique is listed, which is how many Action Points it takes to use. This is typically a value between 1 and 3. If no AP cost is listed, it has no cost and may be used for free.\n&nbsp;\nFollowing that, all Keywords for the Technique are listed. These can be flags such as _Glancing_ that make the Technique less effective, or something like _Pierce_, which makes it far easier to deal with _Guard_.\n&nbsp;\nBetween the body and the header of a Technique there is a colored line that designates the <ins>Type</ins> of the action.\n* **<span style="color: darkblue">General:</span>** A <ins>General</ins> Technique is designated by a blue background and the <img :src="$general" style="height:1em" /> symbol. General Techniques tend to target yourself or the environment, or impact foes in a non-damaging way.\n* **<span style="color: darkred">Strike:</span>** A <ins>Strike</ins> Technique is designated by a red background and the <img :src="$strike" style="height:1em" /> symbol. Strike Techniques typically deal high damage and are the main way to damage opponents.\n* **<span style="color: purple">Move:</span>**  A <ins>Move</ins> Technique is designated by a purple background and the <img :src="$move" style="height:1em" /> symbol. Move Techniques typically provide a great deal of mobility.\n* **<span style="color: gold">Support:</span>** <ins>Support</ins> Techniques are designated by a yellow background and the <img :src="$support" style="height:1em" /> symbol. These Techniques typically target allies, and provide them with valuable resources such as _Momentum_ or _Vigor_ or can allow them to move about during battle.\n* **<span style="color: darkgreen">Defensive:</span>** A <ins>Defensive</ins> Technique is designated by a green background and the <img :src="$defensive" style="height:1em" /> symbol. Defensive Techniques typically make using Resist Maneuvers easier or otherwise enhance your ability to survive.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe remainder of the Technique is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Technique; they are simply here for a comprehensive definition.\n* **Cost** is an up-front cost of a Technique that must be paid when the Technique is played, typically while _Plotting_.\n* **Requirements** are some sort of prerequisite that must be fulfilled before a Technique can be used. \nThis Requirement does not have to be fulfilled when it is played, but does have to be true when the Technique would be used.\n* **Weapon** is a somewhat specialized requirement; if this Technique references _Weapon Attacks_ they must be made using the Weapon type specified by this field.\n* **Target** is what the Technique is going to actually effect. Typically this is a creature, but some Techniques specify that they must target _Features_ or something similar.\n* **Movement** is how far the Technique allows you to move, typically either None, _Step_, _Reposition_, or _Dash_. Refer to your Armor\'s Movement Chart to see how far each of these Movements allows you to go. If a Reaction allows you to use a Technique you do not use its Movement.\n* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Technique. This varies greatly from Technique to Technique, but the Effect box is typically the bulk of what a Technique accomplishes.\n* **Special** is a secondary effect of the Technique, that is typically either conditional or more specific than the primary effect.\n* **Imbue** is an additional Cost you can pay when playing Technique (typically in the Plotting Phase) to increase the effectiveness of a Technique. This often changes the Speed or AP of a Technique, hence why it must be applied when played.\n* **Boost** is an additional cost that is paid when a Technique is used to amplify its power. This additional cost is purely optional, but can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of a Technique.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe last potential field in a Technique is it\'s **Profile**, discussed below.\n\n&nbsp;\n### Reading Attack

Choosing Your Spirit\nThe first, and possibly most important decision that you make as a spiritbound is what type of spirit you are bound to. As far back as any can remember in the world of Deskar, a child's 10th birthday has always been marked by a vivid dream. The specifics vary from person to person, but universally several young spirits are encountered in the dreamscape and, when the child awakes, one is bound to them forevermore. From that day forward the spirit and child are constant companions, lending each other their strength to overcome any feature in their path.\n&nbsp;\nIn general, a spiritbound and their spirit share a body, living in peaceful harmony. However, when either party wishes it, the spirit can assume a diminutive physical form, the appearance of which varies. This is often a side-effect of a spiritbound making use of their powers, although many simply summon their spirit for the company. In times of great danger spirits have been known to *awaken*, an experience where they assume a larger, more powerful form, often at great expense to both the spiritbound and the spirit itself.\n&nbsp;\nThere are six common types of spirits within Deskar, all with their own selection of powers to choose from. A spiritbound can only ever be bound to a singular spirit, so choose wisely!\n&nbsp;\n<img :src=\"$jenna\" v-bind:class=\"mobileOrNormal('earth-circle')\" />\n- **Earth Spirits** are associated with strength, stability, and courage. Earth spirits can manipulate earth and stone, greatly enhance their physical strength, inspire courage in others, and read the subtle motions of the earth to 'see' at great distances. Earth spirits tend to take forms reminiscent of great beasts of burden that are renowned for their strength as well as animals that burrow. They tend to be a bit slower to act when compared with other spirits but are nearly impossible to stop when they decide on a course of action.\n- **Flame Spirits** are associated with power, volatility, and rage. Manipulation of fire and heat are the most common powers displayed by Flame spirits, but they also are capable of greatly enhancing their spiritbound's physical performance, albeit with painful repercussions, fan the flames of rage in themselves and others, and even catch brief glimpses of the future in flames. Flame spirits nearly exclusively take the form of predatory animals, especially ones known for hunting in a pack. Flame spirits are commonly regarded as dangerous to interact with as they are easily offended and quick to take revenge, but those that have dealt with them know that they are just as fiercely loyal to their friends.\n- **Metal Spirits** are associated with Health, progress, and determination. Of all the elements, metal is the most resistant to change but, despite this, Metalbound are able to magnetically control it, enhance its strength and other properties as well as channel it inwards for impossible Health, use it to dampen the senses of foes, or send a crushing wave of despair outward. Metal spirits tend to be smaller in stature than the other elements, and commonly take the form of insects and other armored creatures. Metal Spirits have only become somewhat common since the Sundering, and in this time mankind has found them to be a stalwart ally, if a bit alien in nature compared to the other spirits.\n- **Water Spirits** are associated with fluidity, peace, and adaptability. Water spirits can control water and ice as if it was an extension of their own form, but are also able to exert limited control over the blood of living things, primarily for healing purposes, create an aura of calm, and see into the past to a limited degree. These spirits often take the form of aquatic and amphibious creatures, although it is common for a Water spirit to not have a truly defined form. Water spirits are known for being slow to anger, but also for their long memories. In this new age, people have found river spirits to be one of their most consistent allies, although they bring swift retaliation if disrespected.\n- **Wind Spirits** are associated with freedom, change, and speed. These spirits can conjure powerful winds and sudden lightning storms, but can also enhance the speed and reactions of their spiritbound, invoke a deep, primal fear in foes, and feel the movement of the wind for unparalleled awareness. Wind spirits commonly take the form of creatures capable of flight or those known for their speed but, like Water spirits, tend to be a bit more ephemeral in form. Wind spirits are unpredictable by nature and it takes a clever and wise spiritbound to deal with them. Despite their unpredictability, they are rarely truly malicious except in the most extreme of circumstances.\n- **Wood Spirits** are associated with the wilderness, tradition, and growth. Wood spirits are able to control their namesake, but can also urge plants to grow, transfer life between living things, create powerful feelings of joy, and sense the emotions of those near them. Wood spirits commonly take small mammalian forms, with a preference for vaguely humanoid ones. Wood spirits are commonly regarded as mischievous and often play pranks, even upon their spiritbound. These pranks range from harmless to potentially lethal, causing most to approach wood spirits with an air of caution.\n",He="### Choosing Your Equipment\nThe next decision that will define your spiritbound is what equipment they make use of. A bow, shield and spear, and unarmed combat will all play differently, as will the various types of armor.\n&nbsp;\n",De="A spiritbound's choice in armor will dictate whether they are an agile, mobile combatant or an indestructible object.  As a general rule:\n* Characters that choose No _Armor_ will have exceptional mobility, especially with their ability to _Jump_ greater distances than most characters.\n* Characters that choose Light _Armor_ strike a balance between mobility and defense. They receive some _Guard_ and adequate Movement, but excel at neither.\n* Characters that choose Heavy _Armor_ have exceptional _Guard_ compared to other _Armors_, but limited mobility, especially in their ability to _Jump_. A character in Heavy _Armor_ will stay in the fight far longer than their peers, but may struggle with dangerous attacks that require mobility to avoid, such as those that create _Hazards_.",Ge="The next choice is the type of weapons that a character will wield. In combat, a character can wield up to two hands worth of weaponry at a time. There are many different weapon types, all with their own perks:\n* **Bladed** weapons such as swords and daggers tend to be faster, and provide a balanced approach between mobility and defense. Most bladed weapons inflict _Bleeding_, which can slowly take down a foe over time. Bladed weapons tend to have a higher variance in damage than the other types of weapons and can provide the opportunity for massive damage when attacking at Advantage.\n* **Hafted** weapons such as hammers and axes tend to be slow but powerful weapons that excel at punching through blocks and armor. They can frequently inflict _Exposed_ or _Push_ foes, allowing them to set up powerful combinations with allies. Hafted weapons tend to have a fairly flat damage profile, making them extremely consistent and making _Ward_ Reactions less effective.\n* **Pole** weapons such as spears and pikes boast higher reach and accuracy than other weapon types. Pole weapons tend to inflict _Hobbled_, which limits the mobility of foes, and have various Techniques that allow a skilled Pole user to punish foes that dare enter their reach.\n* **Projectile** weapons such as bows and slings are less accurate than their melee counterparts, but make up for it with extremely high damage and range. As long as a spiritbound is able to catch their foes outside of _Cover_, ranged weapons will deal consistently high damage. With investment in the appropriate _Techniques_ most Ranged weapons can also create dangerous _Hazards_ on the battlefield, punishing immobile foes.\n* **Thrown** weapons are less a category of weapons and more a subset of other weapons. While less accurate than their melee counterparts, _Thrown_ weapons are incredibly fast and allow for a large number of attacks at flexible ranges at the expense of disarming yourself.\n* **Shields** are the least damaging of the weapon types, but enhance a character's ability to _Ward_ attacks. Investing further into shield Disciplines will enhance this capability further and turn a shield-bearer into a mobile fortress capable of defending allies.\n\n&nbsp;\nAmong each of these weapon categories there's a range of different options that provide different tradeoffs between the number of hands they take, their damage, and their speed. Characters may select as many weapons as they wish but must be mindful of the total _Weight_ of their gear. The higher a character's Weight the lower their Movement, and no character may carry more than 16 Weight of equipment.",We="### Choosing Your Arts\nA spiritbound's Arts are more minor abilities that do not define a character's playstyle, but provide additional tools and options in combat.\n&nbsp;\nTo start, gain the Rank 2 Basic Art that matches your spirit's type. For example, if your Spirit is an Earthen Land Spirit, you would have Rank 2 in Basic Land Arts.",Ie="### Choosing Your Disciplines\nA spiritbound's Disciplines reflect how the character is expecting to act in combat, granting Stances and Techniques that they can use to influence the battlefield.\n&nbsp;\nTo start, select one Style Discipline and one Spirit Discipline to place at Rank 2 to ensure you have access to both a Martial and Spirit Stance. Stances are vital for generating the resources you will use in combat and can provide powerful passive effects that shape your playstyle. For your Style Discipline, select one that matches the playstyle you wish to use. If you want to be a tank, for example, selecting a Defender role is essential! For the Spirit Discipline, simply pick something that will grant you magic that you find interesting!\n&nbsp;\nTo start, you Spirit Discipline must match what you picked for your Spirit when you selected it. If your Spirit is an Earthen Land Spirit, you *must* pick a Land Discipline.",Fe="### Choosing Your Talents\nNon-combat, will come later.",Be="### Choosing Your Appearance\nThe people of Deskar are extremely diverse; due to the tumultus and dangerous state of the world people from wildly different homelands and backgrounds have formed communities together. In addition, most have adopted physical traits that are reminiscent of their spirit. For most this manifests as a stereotypical hair or eye color, but some have more extreme expressions, such as a glowing tattoo-like scar, stony skin, or hair that always flows as if in the wind. Your character can be anywhere from a standard human to somebody with heavy feline features, vibrant hair that flickers like flames, and eyes like burning coals.\n&nbsp;\n\nAs important as your spiritbound's appearance is, the appearance of their spirit is just as important. Spirits tend to take the appearance of a small creature, with the general trends outlined earlier in the 'Choosing Your Spirit' section. While they tend towards a specific type of animal, it's not uncommon for spirits' physical forms to be a bit of a hybrid of several different animals. Most spirit's default forms are small enough to comfortably fit on a human's shoulder, although some get as large as a cat or small dog.\n&nbsp;\n\nThe physical form of a spirit tends to take cues from the Techniques and Stances their spiritbound most often makes use of. If a spiritbound primarily specializes in the elemental control disciplines, their spirit is often largely comprised of that element. A windbound that specializes in the Storm Discipline might have a spirit whose physical form is largely comprised of lightning. Spiritbound that specialize in the emotional discipline of their spirit tend to have spirits that are a bit more ghostly and ethereal in nature. Finally, spiritbound that specialize in the physical and sensory applications often have spirits that trend closer to an actual animal in appearance, although they still have odd markings or some indication of their elemental alignment.",je="### Creating Your Background\nY'all have played an RPG, will flesh this out later.",Oe="### Finalizing Your Character\nYou 25 Health!

Narrative Resources\n\nIn narrative play characters must manage their Effort and Spirit gauges. The Effort gauge represents a character's ability to push themselves, while the Spirit gauge represents the same for a character's Spirit. Each is comprised of 6 squares, with empty spaces representing available resources.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf a character's Spirit gauge is ever full they may no longer use Spirit abilities of any kind while their Spirit reconstitutes itself and recovers. Once there is space on the Spirit gauge a character may use their spirit again as normal. If a character's Effort gauge is empty, they instead do not \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWounds are a resource that bridges between narrative and combat play. It is also comprised of 6 empty spaces that are filled as a character becomes more and more injured. Characters typically gain Wounds through the Injury Danger in narrative play or by losing all Health in combat. In narrative play, characters take a 1 die penalty to all rolls whenever they have 3 or more Wounds, and are automatically unconscious at 6 Wounds. If a character with 6 Wounds gains an additional one, they die.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Resolving Conflicts\n\nNarrative play in Shattered Spirits is typically fast-paced and requires few dice rolls; a character's Archetype and Talents provides fairly strict guidance on what a character is capable of and, when the stakes and consequences of failure are low, characters should be able to simply succeed at such tasks, especially if they have other enabling factors such as appropriate equipment or the aid of an ally.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever, when the stakes are high, other factors are attempting to limit a character's chance of success, or the outcome is unclear characters must make a Skill Challenge using their Stakes Sheet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[insert Schema stakes sheet here]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst, based on how your action was described, the GM will determine if it is Bold or Cautious. If it is ambiguous, the player attempting the check may decide which of the two options to pursue. Occasionally, due to Talents are Archetypes, a character may instead roll Skillfully. In this case, they always roll Skillfully.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter that, your GM will set out Stakes for the roll. There should always be an automatic stake, typically providing some minimal amount of progress towards your roll. Your GM will lay out additional Stakes by deciding on the Dangers for this check, and add markers to the appropriate options on your Stakes Sheet. Additionally, your GM may highlight some Augments that are particularly relevant to the current scene. At this point, a character may spend 1 Effort to swap from Bold to Cautious, or vice versa. Additionally, if characters have abilities that allow them to modify the Stakes sheet, they may use them here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlayers automatically roll 3 dice for this check, but may gain additional ones based on a variety of factors:\n* If a character has appropriate gear for the situation, they gain an additional die.\n* If a character has talent or magic appropriate for the current situation, they gain an additional die, or two if appropriate.\n* If a character has a condition that would hinder their ability to succeed, they may lose a die.\n* If a character has done work to prepare for a situation or has set up some other advantage, they may gain a die.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter determining the character's die pool, characters roll their d6s. A result of 1-2 is a &#8863;, a result of 3-4 is a &#9634;, and a result of 5-6 is a &#8862;. If acting Cautiously, characters reroll &#9634; and &#8862;, while if they are rolling Boldly they reroll &#8863; and &#9634;. If a character is rolling Skillfully, they may reroll dice of their choice. If a character does not wish to reroll, they may spend 1 Effort to not reroll.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter completing rolls, characters assign their available dice to Augments and Dangers. The GM then narrates the scene, and applies appropriate consequences and conditions.\n",Ga=i["default"].extend({name:"narrative-rules",computed:{narrativeText(){return
