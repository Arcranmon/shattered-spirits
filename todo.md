## To-Do

- Rework things so that at the start of each Phase you choose your Stance
  - One action per Round (in each Phase, Players->Enemies)
  - Stances should all have the following (even if the value is 0):
    - How much Guard they grant
    - Their Speed
    - Their bonuses to Grit/Focus/Reflex
    - How much Stun you clear at the start of the Phase
    - Additional Momentum count
- Make Interacts a more intrinsic part of the system
  - Roll 1d6 for a single die + tags
- Add a general support/social interact you can use to buff allies or taunt enemies

### Brainstorming

- Make Encumbrance instead grant Movement per phase? Instead of an open pool?
- Can only use a given ability (including a Weapon) once per phase?
  - How to handle 'juggling'
- Better grabbing mechanics
  - Riding vs. Grappling
  - Binding effects

### Plan

POTENTIAL REFACTORS

- Add a Glossary that includes most terms
- Streamline statuses
  - More potent, but no stacks
  - Add a 'Stun' bar as well that can be used by players as juice
    - Essentially replaces Vulnerable/Reeling
    - Gambits will typically clear Stun to inflict additional effects
- Up the Guard bonuses from Armor?
  - Piecemeal armor? Shirt/Chest/Greaves/Hands/Feet/Head?
  - Probably a dumb idea...
- Move to a Skill Tree system (maybe)
  - Probably just Basic Arts for different Archetypes
  - Instead of Arts/Disciplines Major/Minor Disciplines?
- Stance passives may need to be more impactful to enable stance dancing
- Basic stuff to moved out:
  - Hide, Raise Guard, Tumble, Flank, Engage, Dodge (?), Aim, Mark, Basic Sunder, Basic Flourish, Basic Feint
  - Examples:
  - Most Gambits go to Art stuff

LONG TERM

- Cooler buttons.
- Develop consumable items that characters can choose to take at the start of an expedition and develop some Skill Arts for them.
- Arts to support Weapons/Unarmed, and more weapon types.
  - Make Charging Ram an Art
- Refine Health and Health system based on how long combats should last.
  - Once the rest of the system is in a good place, consider adding Day, Night, and Beast Spirit Arts.
  - Add an additional 'bending' Discipline to each Element:
    - Earth: Dust
    - Flame: Smoke/Ash
    - Metal: ???
    - Water: ???
    - Wind: Sound
    - Wood: Poison
- Develop some basic NPC stat blocks for testing.
  - Make some less basic NPC stat blocks for fun.
  - Develop BIG SPIRIT FIGHTS where simply killing them is the easy answer, but it's possible to instead save them by greatly increasing the difficulty of the fight.
- Make some good player tools. This will probably require some sort of play board so players can easily track conditions and their own Initiative.
- Non-combat gameplay does not currently exist in any meaningful form and needs to be built once the combat system is in a good place.
- Combat abilities are governed by Disciplines
  - Travel abilities are governed by Jobs
  - Narrative abilities are governed by Talents and Knacks
- Create a system for exploration and camping and expeditions that is resource management-lite but rewards players with combat resources.
- Create a 'home base' sort of system that allows for a town or city to develop over time depending on whether players take a more aggressive approach against the spirits or seek healing and peace.
