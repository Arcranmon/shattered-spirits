### Minor Mishaps
- Typically are just characters gaining Stress
- Should be an RP hook or something that can be hooked into
- Can also inflict random little conditions
- Better to list these out or just make them up as we go?
- Should they be regional or just present?

### Mishaps
- Should be Fatigue and minor Wounds
- Accidents, things going wrong on the journey, and avoidable mistakes

### Menaces
- These are the REAL dangers on the journey
- Varying levels of bad, but always more dangerous than a Minor Mishap

First Day of Travel:
- Have a Minor Mishap, Mishap, and an Angry Spirits Menace

STRUCTURE
- Have the Event Deck be things that WILL happen. Weather, people they run into on the road, things that (barring a significant detour) just occur
- Menace Deck is dangers on the road that the party will hit if they are not Cautious
- Exploration Deck is interesting places that, if the party explores, they can find for potential benefits. They could also be dangerous but, if they are, there's an important reason to deal with them
