### Supply
Shattered Spirits lacks currency; instead, it deals with a more abstract system of Supply, which represents items you can trade, general goodwill, and your own ability to produce items. Characters will be given a pool of Supply at character creation, as well as at the end of missions to purchase and replace Equipment.
