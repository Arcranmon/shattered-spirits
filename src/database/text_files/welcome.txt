### Welcome to Shattered Spirits!

Here, humanity and spirits are closely bound, with nearly all having a spiritual companion: an elemental creature formed from the elements that is ever-present. They provide companionship, insight and, perhaps mostly importantly, mastery of the elements themselves. Together humanity and their bound spirits have thrived for generations, forging bonds and conquering features with their shared strength. While the world is harsh, full of terrible beasts and primal spirits that rampage across the lands, humanity has been able to carve out small existences, surviving in the liminal spaces between the realms of greater spirits.
&nbsp;
However, these fragile spaces are under threat. Great spirits, long dormant within their stone and seas, are stirring once more. Great lights are seen in the night and plumes of smoke in the day, emanating from the ruins of the Old World. Terrible beasts grow ever more bold, roaming closer and closer to the towns and villages. Most concerning, children who complete their Binding awake screaming, with no idea of the cause of their terror.
&nbsp;
You are a Spiritbound of rare skill. While all in this world are bound to a spirit, your talent and your spirit's prowess set you apart within your hometown. You and your spirit companion are perhaps all that stands between your town and the ruin that is growing ever-closer; can you find the strength to stop it?
