### Welcome to the Shattered World!

Here, the earth has been split asunder, the sky has fallen, and the rules of the natural world no longer apply. Spirits, ancient and terrible, decide what reality should look like, and gravity is no more a universal constant than the weather is. Oceans burn and mountains fly yet, through it all, humanity perseveres.
&nbsp;
Humanities only saving grace in this world are their ever-present element companion. These spirits provide companionship, insight and, perhaps mostly importantly, mastery of the elements themselves. Together humanity and their bound spirits have found a place within this shattered world, forging bonds and conquering obstacles with their shared strength and carving out meager existences in the liminal spaces between the realms of greater spirits.

These fragile spaces are under threat. Great spirits, long dormant within their stone and seas, are stirring once more. Great lights are seen in the night and plumes of smoke in the day, emanating from the ruins of the Old World. Terrible beasts grow ever more bold, roaming closer and closer to the towns and villages. Most concerning, children who complete their Binding awake screaming, with no idea of the cause of their terror.
&nbsp;
You are a Spiritbound of rare skill. You, your companion, and others like you are perhaps all that stands between your town and the ruin that is growing ever-closer; can you find the strength to stop it? Or will your home become yet another shattered ruin on the horizon?
