When playing Shattered Spirits, there's a few primary pillars to gameplay that are all interwoven and feed into one another, with slightly different rules between them.

&nbsp;
The primary and most common state of play is **Narrative**. In this mode, players roleplay, problem solve, and make decisions. Characters abilities are largely defined by their Archetype and Talents, as well as the types of spiritcraft they have decided to specialize in. When players need to break in to a house, soothe an agitated spirit, or solve a puzzle they will use this style of gameplay.

&nbsp;
An important offshoot of Narrative is the **Journey**. Characters in the Shattered World have to travel great distances to find solutions, and the Journey mode is a specialized version of Narrative gameplay specifically for that, abstracting problems and timelines to better fit with extended journeys.

&nbsp;
Not all problems can be solved without violence and, when that is the case, **Combat** is entered. This is a more tactical gameplay mode, where characters move about an abstracted map, using their equipment, skills, and spiritcraft to accomplish their goals.

&nbsp;
Finally, we have **Downtime**, an extended period where characters have no pressing goals, no looming timelines, and can simply exist in a space. This tends to flow in and out of Narrative play as characters encounter problems, but is how weeks or months of time in the world can be played in a single session.
