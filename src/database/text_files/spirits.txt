Spirits are everywhere within the Shattered World and influence every aspect of it. They are wild, dangerous creatures formed from element power, enjoying immense potential in their element and able to contend with anything the Shattered World throws their way. In many ways, they tend to act as animals, forming packs, protecting their territory, and other recognizable behaviors. However, behind this, there is always a slightly alien intelligence that humans struggle to understand, and misunderstanding why a spirit is doing something is a common cause for conflict. Spirits are never evil but, like a wild animal or a storm, are always dangerous.
&nbsp;
Spirits are as innumerable as grains of sand and, while there are trends in their behavior, they seem to find great joy in defying any attempts to classify them into discrete types. That said, the below categorizations seem to be true more often than not.
&nbsp;
### Earth Spirits
Spirits of earth tend to take the form of animals known for their strength and stamina, although many lesser earth spirits take the form of small burrowing animals such as moles. Regardless, it's rare for an earth spirit to ever fully leave the ground; typically, just the head is visible above the ground, with the body remaining hidden underground. Earth spirits are typically stubborn and slow to change like the earth itself, but are a reliable companion.
&nbsp;
### Flame Spirits
Flame spirits are commonly found in the form of predators and hunters, favoring feline and reptilian forms. They are fully capable of controlling their flames and can will them to not burn others, although its rare for a flame spirit to accept physical touch. They are spirits of extreme laziness, often content to remain a smoldering fire and not move for extended periods and incredible violence as they seek more fuel for their flame. They are a powerful but capricious companion.
&nbsp;
### Metal Spirits
Spirits of metal are rare, odd spirits that do not typically manifest as large creatures. They prefer the form of insects, crustaceans, and other armored animals. They have a reputation for being cold, but whether this is a real trait or a side-effect of their forms being difficult to read for humans is up for debate. Regardless, they tend to be stalwart but incomprehensible spirits.
&nbsp;
### Water Spirits
Water spirits are ever flowing and take myriad, fluid forms although ocean-dwelling creatures and snakes tend to be common forms. They tend to take the path of least resistance, and are a calm, moderate spirit. They can exist for extended periods without water, although they take great joy in swimming and being submerged. They are typically considered the easiest spirit to deal with, as they will frequently avoid combat just on the basis of peace being easier.
&nbsp;
### Wind Spirits
Spirits of wind tend to take the form of nimble, agile animals, especially those that can fly. Wind spirits are rarely ever fully formed even when they materialize; often small portions of their form remain wispy and wraith-like with little corporeal element. They are flighty, unpredictable spirits but are rarely actively malicious, simply a bit destructive in their whims.
&nbsp;
### Wood Spirits
Wood spirits are common and spread throughout the world, dwelling inside every plant. Those that decide to manifest are fond of small mammals, particularly those that are well-suited for climbing. Wood spirits seem to be a bit more intelligent than the other types, and tend to have an almost human sense of humor.
&nbsp;
### Hybrid Elements
While the above categories tend to hold true, many spirits within the world are some combination of elements. This typically results in some melding of their personalties, but can always have unpredictable outcomes.
&nbsp;
### Bound Spirits
Everyone in the Shattered World is bound to a spirit, a manifestation of elemental power that takes an animalistic form. Sometime before puberty children will face their Binding; a dream where they first meet their spirit and form their initial connection. In the coming weeks the spirit begins to take physical form, and the child's craft begins to awaken. While the physical aspect takes time, the bond between spirit and companion begins as soon as the Binding is complete, and the comforting presence of their spirit sharing space in their mind is established. The relationship is deeper than a simple pet and owner; both parties are equal in the relationship and share an empathetic bond, giving them a deep insight into one another. In most cases spirits and their companion share a deep bond, although in same cases incompatible personalities can result in a more fraught relationship.
&nbsp; 
Unlike other spirits, bound spirits seem to follow more strict bounds, likely due to the human influence. They are commonly between the size of a rat and a horse, manifest with obvious animal traits, and only ever are influenced by a single element. Typically, when a bound spirit first appears its form is a bit more amorphous but, over time, tends to settle into a more defined form, although this sometime does not happen until their companion is well into adulthood. Bound spirits can take physical form or return to a more purely-elemental form at a whim, although most keep their spirit manifested as much as possible.
&nbsp;
The bond between a spirit and their companion is, in addition to its benefits, dangerous. If one half of a pair dies and the other survives, the other is certainly soon to follow. Losing your spirit is beyond simply losing a pet or a companion; they are a piece of one another, and the hole that is left behind can never be filled. If the spirit dies, the human tends to struggle with intense depression, wastes away, and slowly loses access to their craft. If they survive the first few months after the loss of a spirit they can live a few years, but typically do not make it longer. A spirit fades away much more quickly if their companion dies; they last on an order of days or weeks before simply dissipating. In some cases, the spirit might go on a rampage after their companion's death, avenging them and attempting to resolve any lingering regrets. Undertakers are incredibly important due to this, not only to ensure the dead are treated with respect but to not anger their spirit. In extreme cases, a bound spirit can become a daemon after their companion dies, although these cases are exceedingly rare.
&nbsp;
### Dormant Spirits
Much of the spirits within the world are dormant; they do not take physical form, and tend to not react to stimulus. Whether this be because they are weak or simply asleep varies, but everything within the world is infused with spirits, from the smallest stone to the largest mountain. In general, these spirits exert very little influence on the world, but permeate every aspect of it.
### Wild Spirits
Wild spirits are much of the world, and have little to no consistency in their demeanor. They permeate everything, as shapeless elemental forces active in the world and as physical creatures, similar to Bound Spirits, that take action within the world. They tend to be strongly linked with a specific element or subset of craft, but can easily be formed from multiple. Wild spirits are what are commonly encountered in the world, especially while traveling, and can either be a potential ally or dangerous foe depending on how they are dealt with. Powerful Wild Spirits will often establish their own territory and learning where to avoid and where is safe is a critical part of traversing the Shattered World.
### Guardians
Spirits of great power that, for whatever reason, have traits that make it possible to build a town within their domain. Guardians have slightly more defined traits, mostly because they are a very specific subset of spirits. Among spirits, they tend to be kinder towards humans, less fickle and, of course, powerful enough to keep other spirits at bay from presence alone.
### Great Spirits
Among spirits, Great Spirits stand at the pinnacle. They typically resemble a force of nature more than an actual physical thing and have a vast domain; an entire mountain might be a Great Spirit's purview, with smaller, lesser spirits dividing up the domain among themselves. A Great Spirit is an unstoppable force but, for the most part, they do not tend to act intentionally against anything other than other Great Spirits. That does not mean they are not a concern; the movement or awakening of a Great Spirit is still a calamity unlike most others, and can easily wipe several towns off the map in the blink of an eye.
### Daemons
Of all the spirits discussed, there is only one hard rule: they do not speak with the human tongue. There are spirits that can mimic, and some spiritbound can carry their own words through their spirit, but these are simply echoes, not true speech. Every child learns from a young age that they should be cautious of spirits and never anger them and, more importantly, if they ever hear a spirit speak to run as fast and far as they can. Spirits that can speak the human tongue are called Daemons, and, even among spirits, are the most dangerous.
&nbsp;
What makes a Daemon is unclear, but they are vastly more intelligent and capricious than most spirits. They have egos, goals, and motivations beyond what is typical for spirits, and tend to have immense and strange power. They are the only spirits that adopt humanoid forms, although due to their presence and elemental form none could ever mistake them for a human.
