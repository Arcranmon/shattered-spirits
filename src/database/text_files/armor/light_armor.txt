Padded or reinforced leather armor, potentially with small amounts of metal plate are common examples of Light Armor. Light Armor strikes a balance between maneuverability and block, providing a small amount of _Block_ without severely handicapping movement. Their Reactions tend to be a middle-ground between _Warding_ and _Evading_, and often allow using _Momentum_ in a defensive manner.
