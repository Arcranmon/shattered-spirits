While not true Equipment, wearing No Armor has its own benefits. Characters that wear No Armor typically have no _Block_ provided by their _Armor_ but, in exchange, get access to higher _Jump_ values as well as Movement, allowing them to more easily maneuver around the battlefield. In addition, No Armor often provides powerful _Evade_ Reactions that can push a character's mobility even further.
