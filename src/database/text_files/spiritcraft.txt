The art of manipulating your element is called spiritcraft and is something that everybody bound to a spirit can do to at least a small degree. Most denizens of the Shattered World go far beyond that though, specializing in specific applications of the craft to make their day-to-day life easier, whether that be practicing specific techniques to heat reagents *just* right or large scale earthcraft to plow a field.

Spiritcraft is a highly personalized skillset, with everybody's expression of the same techniques varying ever so slightly. The human is effectively just a conduit for the raw power coming from their spirit, and their visualization and intent shapes how that energy is manifested. In general, for anything beyond the most basic of spiritcraft people will make use of chants, hand signs, or complicated gestures that they have drilled time and time again to minimize the risk of mishap and ensure their intent is manifested properly.

What spiritcraft can accomplish is constantly evolving, with spiritbound constantly finding new applications for their craft. The only truly hard limit seems to be the elemental one; no matter how one trains, a flame spirit will never be able to create a wall of stone, and a wind spirit will never be able to shape metal like clay. People continue to try to push through this limitation, as wild spirits don't seem to be constrained in the same way, leaving some doubt that this is truly an impossible hurdle.

&nbsp;
Within each element there are a handful of different Disciplines, or common forms and techniques for that element. Each element has several broad ways that they can manipulate their element, an emotion linked to their element they can manipulate, a physical enhancement they can draw out, and some sense they can enhance.
