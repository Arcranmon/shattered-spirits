The art of manipulating your element is called spiritcraft and is something that everybody bound to a spirit can do to at least a small degree. Most denizens of the Shattered World go far beyond that though, specializing in specific applications of the craft to make their day-to-day life easier, whether that be practicing specific techniques to heat reagents *just* right or large scale earthcraft to plow a field.
&nbsp;

Spiritcraft is a highly personalized skillset, with everybody's expression of the same techniques varying ever so slightly. The human is effectively just a conduit for the raw power coming from their spirit, and their visualization and intent shapes how that energy is manifested. In general, for anything beyond the most basic of spiritcraft people will make use of chants, hand signs, or complicated gestures that they have drilled time and time again to minimize the risk of mishap and ensure their intent is manifested properly.

&nbsp;
What spiritcraft can accomplish is constantly evolving, with spiritbound constantly finding new applications for their craft. The only truly hard limit seems to be the elemental one; no matter how one trains, a flame spirit will never be able to create a wall of stone, and a wind spirit will never be able to shape metal like clay. People continue to try to push through this limitation, as wild spirits don't seem to be constrained in the same way, leaving some doubt that this is truly an impossible hurdle.

&nbsp;
Within each element there are a handful of different Disciplines, or common forms and techniques for that element. Each element has several broad ways that they can manipulate their element, an emotion linked to their element they can manipulate, a physical enhancement they can draw out, and some sense they can enhance.

&nbsp;
### Elemental Sense
All with craft are able to sense latent spirits that align with their element, although without training and focus this tends to be quite limited. With sufficient effort this can be expanded, with some able to sense their element across vast distances. In dangerous climates many waterbound are pushed to develop this ability as soon as possible.
&nbsp;
### Earthcraft
Those that are Bonded to an earth spirit draw upon the power of the earth and stone, shaping the terrain around them and making both their will and stance as sturdy as the earth itself. With their connection to the earth, earthbonded can amplify both their physical strength spirit many times over, wielding weapons that would be impossible for a normal Bonded to even lift much less make use of. The earth strengthens their spirits to a similar degree, and earthbonded have earned a reputation as either the most courageous or most reckless of warriors, depending on who you ask. Finally, earthbonded are valued extremely highly as scouts, as they can 'see' through the earth itself, allowing them to track enemies across vast distances or see even in impossible visibility.
&nbsp;
### Flamecraft
Flamecraft is most commonly known for producing, controlling, and otherwise manipulating flame, with experts able to create flames that burn only what they wish. With training, they can learn to manipulate heat itself. They can channel the power of the flame inward, burning internally to enhance their physical prowess many times over. Flame is the element of rage and anger, and manipulating that emotion falls within the purview of flamecraft. Finally, by looking into flames flamebound can see into the future, with the quality and relevance of the image depending on their own skill as well as the size of the blaze. Flamecraft is a dangerous discipline, and nearly every flamebound has some significant burn due to a training accident.
&nbsp;
### Metalcraft
A stubborn element, metal refuses to allow itself to be easily manipulated. While a metalbound can never achieve the same degree of mass manipulation as an earth or waterbound, they boast exceptional power and precision with their limited abilities to control metal. Additionally, they have an immense capacity to influence the shape and qualities of metal, making it nigh-indestructible or as weak as paper. Metal is the element of grief, and a metalbound can throw others into deep despair. When focused physically, metalbound gain impossible endurance and resilience that allows them to ignore all but the worst of injuries and push through impossible odds. When used on their sense, metalcraft enhances mundane senses many times over, allowing them to see and hear at exceptional distances.
&nbsp;
### Watercraft
Water is a fluid and graceful element, and the most prized type of craft in much of the world. It's useful for the obvious act of controlling and moving water, but adept practitioners can learn to control its phase and manipulate ice and snow as well. Physically, water and blood are closely linked, and a waterbound can learn to manipulate them as if they were one and the same, providing a horrific weapon or incredible medical skills. When focusing on emotions, water brings a deep sense of calm and peace, and can providing a comforting presence for others. Just as fire can see into the future, water can see the past, with the quality of the effect dependent on their own skill and the quality of the water. By submerging something they can shape this vision, focusing it on said object.
&nbsp;
### Windcraft
Those that are Bonded to an wind spirit draw upon the wild and untamed power of wind and storm. Windbonded can easily unleash powerful gales and blasts of lightning, creating storms every bit as vicious as those found in nature. By imbuing themselves with the essence of wind they can greatly enhance their reaction speed and movement. They can spark the deep, primal fear of the unknown in others, causing lesser foes to flee before them on the battlefield. Finally, their ability to sense through the wind grants a Windbound excellent awareness of the area, allowing them to notice things that few others could hope to find.
&nbsp;
### Woodcraft
Wood is the element of growth, and is the only living element that is manipulated. Most woodcraft focuses on controlling long-dead wood that only has spirits within it, controlling and shaping it with a thought. Skilled crafters can instead control living plants, encouraging growth and forcing impossible structures. Physically, wood allows sharing and giving lifeforce between different creatures, allowing others to heal by harming another. By focusing on their senses woodcraft can reveal the emotional state of nearby creatures, reading their aura and determining their current emotional state. Wood is the element of joy, and woodcraft can inspire comforting joy, as well as wild, uncontrollable ecstasy. This ability to force a good reaction often makes others innately distrustful of woodbound, even if they don't specialize in that aspect of the craft.
