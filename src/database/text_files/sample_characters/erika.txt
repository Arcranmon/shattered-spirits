### Erika, Vicki, and Belle
*An artist and enjoyer of herbs with a two-headed antelope companion.*
While she is technically the apprentice herbalist in Serpent Village, Erika is better known as a troublemaker and slacker within the town. She would much rather practice her sculptures or try to splice two random plants together than actually deal with the mundanity of work. She is very close with Winona (who constantly covers for her), and is constantly fighting with Blaine.

Erika is rarely seen without flowers in her hair and covering slightly more of her clothing than might be considered reasonable. She exercises her craft easily and often, and constantly adorns herself with simple but impossible plant growths. In theory she would be a poor candidate for the town guard, but Vicki and Belle are so ferocious that they more than compensate for her generally calm demeanor. More importantly, almost all of the town guard shifts are exceptionally boring, providing an excellent opportunity to slack off.

&nbsp;
Despite her slacking, Erika has a (somewhat) noble goal: find a way to make a tree that can grow Dreamweed, grow that tree into an elegant and magnificent crown-shaped and giant-serpent-head-sized sculpture, and let the town relax a little bit more with The Great Serpent a bit more pacified. This is, of course, a long ways from completion and, at least for now, Erika would much rather relax and make friends within the village.

Vicki and Belle are Erika's spirit; an antelope-like creature woven from bark and vines, covered in small vibrant flowers and berries and, naturally, has two heads. Erika is quite adamant that Vicki and Belle have distinct personalities and act differently, although nobody else in the town seems to be able to tell the difference. Vicki and Belle are incredibly friendly and can be found roaming the town at all times. They love children and sugar and hate cats.
