### Margaret and Queen
*A farmgirl that desperately wants to get away from Serpent Village and her large, imposing earth spirit that can easily be distracted with fetch.*
&nbsp;
Part of a small group of homesteaders, Margaret has had a rougher upbringing. Outside the bounds of Serpent Village life is innately harder, and Margaret has been used to fighting spirits and long treks to and from her farm for a long time. Within the town, she's closest with Blaine and constantly struggles with Erika's attitude.
&nbsp;
Margaret is a towering figure, standing a full head above most of her peers. She has broad shoulders and skin that has been heavily tanned from working in the sun constantly. Her eyes add to the intimidation factor; her irises are shaped like a cut gem and faintly glow a soft purple, matching Queen's eyes.
&nbsp;
Having spent her time on a homestead, Margaret has always had a more positive impression of Serpent Village than her peers; coming to town meant a reprieve from work, exciting supplies, and other novelties that did not exist in her home. It also meant an escape from the Goat of the Cave, the spirit her small farm dealt with for their farmland. While not particularly dangerous, part of the deal with the Goat of the Cave seemed to be that it was allowed to intrude on their dreams, leading to a variety of unpleasant dairy-themed dreams.
&nbsp;
Right now, Margaret's dream is to establish her own homestead away from the Goat of the Cave and perhaps a bit closer to Serpent Village. That, however, is easier said than done. Finding an area with an amicable spirit that would allow establishing a farm is always difficult, and the area around Serpent Village seems to be all but exhausted.
&nbsp;
Margaret's spirit is Queen, a massive bear-like dog (or perhaps dog-like bear) made of soil and stone. Queen manifested early for Margaret (a common occurrence for homesteaders) and, perhaps because of that, has a strong protective instinct. She is a friendly spirit, although does not quite seem to grasp her own size and weight. Margaret loves cheese and hates goats. She is indifferent on goat cheese.
