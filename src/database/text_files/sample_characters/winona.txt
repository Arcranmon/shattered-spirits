### Winona and Pepper
*A skilled archer and capable hunter who's icy demeanor is undermined by her jovial winged rat wind spirit.*
&nbsp;
A harsh and brusque member of Snake Village, Winona and her family live just on the outskirts of town, and are well-known as accomplished hunters and foragers. Others tend to be scared to approach her and she is constantly in conflict with Marlon, although Erika swears that, once you get past her shell, Winona is actually quite sweet.
&nbsp;
Winona is one of the town's most reliable hunters and has been from a frighteningly young age, somehow always finding food even when the woods seemed empty. She's far more comfortable in the woods and the silence it brings, but seems to get far too into every event or festival she's included in. Nobody knows about it, but she's kept a collection of pelts to try to trade for a nice dress at the Silver Sky Festival, although she hasn't quite figured out how to accomplish that trade without Marlon noticing.
&nbsp;
Unlike the others, Winona struggles to come up with a grand goal. Right now, she's swamped with trying to keep the rest of her family fed, as her father seems to have a kind but difficult habit of taking in anybody that needs help, resulting in her having six younger adopted siblings. She hopes that someday she can make a trip out to Squidport and see the sea, but it's not quite time for that. If pressed hard, she'll admit that she wants to someday hunt the wandering beasts of the Greenvale and stop their rampage across the region.
&nbsp;
Winona's spirit, Pepper, is almost the complete opposite of her facade. A small furry rodent of indeterminate species, Pepper has two iridescent butterfly-like wings and enjoys nothing more than flying around the town, greeting other villagers, and collecting small objects. The only reason people know Winona is in town is typically because Pepper is out and about. Pepper loves bananas (even though he's only had one, they don't grow near Serpent Village) and absolutely hates the smell of most herbs.
