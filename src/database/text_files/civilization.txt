### Civilization in the Shattered World
Humanity persists in the Shattered World, but the presence of spirits has forced civilization to adapt. Spirits can be viciously territorial, and the destruction of their domain to create houses is not looked upon favorably. This has forced small groups of humans to settle into towns between the domains of more hostile spirits.
&nbsp;
### Guardian Spirits
Were it not for a town's Guardian, roaming beasts and spirits would likely have destroyed the last shreds of humanity long ago. To call these spirits a Guardian is a charitable interpretation of their goals; in reality, it would be better to call the relationship between a Guardian and their village a symbiotic, if mildly parasitic one. Guardians are a spirit of sufficient power to keep other spirits out of their territory but, for whatever reason, are able to tolerate the presence of humans.
&nbsp;
At the center of a village's relationship with their Guardian is the Pact; an informal series of rituals and customs the members of the town take part in to placate their Guardian and assure they remain pacified and present. Informal is the key word in that statement; Guardians, like other spirits, are not capable of speech, and tend to be animalistic in intelligence. The Pact is not a formally codified set of terms and conditions, but rather an ever-evolving series of practices learned through trial and error. Groups that are not able to maintain their Pact rarely last long, as they either draw the wrath of their Guardian or drive their Guardian away, leaving them vulnerable to all manner of spirits.
&nbsp;
How exactly this relationship develops varies from town to town, and depends quite heavily on the Pact. Some villages have simple, lenient Pacts that cause them to develop a positive impression of their Guardian. This has, in the past, been the bane of many villages that became too comfortable with their arrangement and did not properly respect how fickle and dangerous their Guardian could be. In other cases, the Pact is extremely oppressive, forcing towns to specialize in odd ways or bend their way of life drastically, leading to resentment towards their Guardian.
&nbsp;
### Towns and Villages
Small villages and towns dot the landscape of the Shattered World, spread into the small safe spaces where they can flourish. Most tend to be small, numbering in the hundreds of people, and heavily influenced by their Guardian spirit and what they do to placate them. Ironwing Village, for example, has an inordinate number of smiths that spend much of their days producing metallic flowers to keep the deadly swarm of metallic butterfly spirits occupied. Most also tend to work the motif of their spirit into their day to day lives, frequently sporting tattoos or decorated clothing that matches their Guardian.
&nbsp;
Towns, unfortunately, do have a limit on how many people they can support. Once available land is gone and there is nowhere nearby to establish a homestead, towns struggle to support the population. Once this happens people tend to leave, either to find a town with better opportunities or, if they are particularly bold, to find a new Guardian and establish their own.
&nbsp;
### Trade and Currency
&nbsp;
While fertile land, access to water and other common constraints are important for creating a town the limitations of finding a Guardian have caused settlements to be scattered across the landscape. Most are at least several days apart, if not more. This makes large-scale trade between towns somewhat difficult. Most beasts of burden struggle to traverse the Shattered World, and wagons would be all but impossible. Anything that too closely resembles a road tends to be destroyed by curious earth spirits, and any shipments by boat must be carefully protected to ensure nearby water spirits are not angered. There are impromptu networks of 'road shrines'; small constructions scattered between towns that travelers can put offerings in, with the goal to eventually coax the local spirits to help guide travelers that way to earn a reward. This has been met with mixed success, but seems promising.
&nbsp;
At this point, there is not a strong concept of currency within the Shattered World. While it can be found in old ruins, it doesn't have much intrinsic worth. Within towns trade is a very loose concept; with few exceptions, people trade labor and supplies readily and do their best to support the community. Between towns, trade largely functions on a barter system, whether that be precious pelts, raw resources, or specialized manufactured goods.
&nbsp;
### Conflict Between Towns
On the surface, towns typically do their best to assist one another; with the forced specialization that accommodating a Guardian requires and the shortage of resources, some level of cooperation is required. Most towns abide by strict rules of hospitality, and harming a traveler is a near universal evil. This, however, does not mean that everything is peaceful between villages.
&nbsp;
Raids by bandits are not uncommon and while they are typically people living outside the bounds of towns and such, sometimes 'bandits' are in-reality another town raiding for supplies. These conflicts tend to be brief, well-planned and violent, with bandits getting in and out before the Guardian or concentrated defenses can react. Homesteaders, with their limited protection, are a common target for bandits and the like, and need to be constantly on guard.
&nbsp;
Actually conquering a village is nearly impossible. While Guardians are fickle and dangerous, most seem to have some level of affection for their wards, and killing them will likely make that spirit no longer a suitable Guardian. Conquering a town would require turning the Guardian against the current residents, a lofty proposition for even the most cunning of spiritbound.
&nbsp;
### Homesteaders
While most folks live in towns, it's rare that a Guardian has a large enough domain and would be alright with large fields. That is the domain of homesteaders; farmers, ranchers, and other occupations that require significant land. They find small areas that aren't sufficient for a town, but could support a family or two and a field. They tend to have a much simpler relationship with their local spirit. These spirits lack the power of a Guardian, but tend to be easier to deal with as a result. It's not uncommon for homesteaders to fight alongside their local spirit when other spirits attempt to intrude, forming a much more symbiotic relationship.
&nbsp;
Technically, homesteaders just need an area they can build and put down roots and do not require the aid of a spirit like a town would. Due to this, some will kill an area's spirit rather than attempting to cooperate. This tends to work well in the short term, but often results in the homesteader constantly contending with new spirits attempting to establish a domain there and, without significant effort, the area will tend to degrade without a spirit tied to it.
&nbsp;
Whether due to living in harsher conditions or being more closely tied to a spirit, homesteaders seem to have an enhanced capability with their craft and almost always manifest larger spirits than people who live in towns.
&nbsp;
### Inns
Finally, existing outside the typical structure listed above, are inns. Towns rarely have a dedicated inn, instead allowing travelers use of spare beds in residents' homes. Throughout the wilds, usually at somewhat natural crossroads are inns, living far beyond the bounds that even homesteaders risk. They are a welcome respite for travelers, and most journeys are structured to take advantage of these locations.
&nbsp;
Innkeepers are nearly always eccentrics and incredibly capable spiritbound. They have chosen to risk the wilds rather than a town, and constantly deal with all manner of travelers. The payment they require lacks any standardization; sometimes, information is enough for a room, while other times they might require a specific request or specialized items. They are almost as dangerous to deal with as a spirit, but have a wealth of knowledge that is difficult to match.
