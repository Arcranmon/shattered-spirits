### Civilization in the Shattered World
Humanity persists in the Shattered World, but the presence of spirits has forced civilization to adapt. Spirits can be viciously territorial, and the destruction of their domain to create houses is not looked upon favorably. This has forced small groups of humans to settle into towns between the domains of more hostile spirits. Humanity is a collection of scattered towns, forced to abide the whims of their Defenseians for some modicum of safety in this world.

### Defenseian Spirits
Were it not for a town's Defenseian, roaming beasts and spirits would likely have destroyed the last shreds of humanity long ago. To call these spirits a Defenseian is a charitable interpretation of their goals; in reality, it would be better to call the relationship between a Defenseian and their village a symbiotic, if mildly parasitic one. Defenseians are a spirit of sufficient power to keep other spirits out of their territory but, for whatever reason, are able to tolerate the presence of humans.
&nbsp;
At the center of a village's relationship with their Defenseian is the Pact; an informal series of rituals and customs the members of the town take part in to placate their Defenseian and assure they remain pacified and present. Informal is the key word in that statement; Defenseians, like other spirits, are not capable of speech, and tend to be animalistic in intelligence. The Pact is not a formally codified set of terms and conditions, but rather an ever-evolving series of practices learned through trial and error. Groups that are not able to maintain their Pact rarely last long, as they either draw the wrath of their Defenseian, or drive their Defenseian away, leaving them vulnerable to all manner of spirits.
