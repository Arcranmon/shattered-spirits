### Roleplay Basics
In narrative gameplay players roleplay as their characters, using their character's goals, abilities, and knowledge to inform their decisions. 
&nbsp;

Narrative play in Shattered Spirits is typically fast-paced and requires few dice rolls; a character's Archetype, Talents, and Spiritcraft provide fairly strict guidance on what a character is capable of through Triggers, as well as  specific abilities that can be used to enhance their results.

&nbsp;

### Skill Challenges
In many situations, dice are not needed to resolve a situation in Shattered Spirits. If a character has an ability that lists 'Strong' as one of its Triggers, they should be able to accomplish many strength-based tasks without consulting the dice. As a general rule of thumb, if there is no time constraint, minimal consequences to failure, and the character can simply retry something as-needed then a character with the appropriate Triggers should simply succeed in the task. A character's Triggers and magic can accomplish many things without the need to create a skill challenge, and a character's investments should be respected.

&nbsp;

However, when the stakes are high or the outcome is unclear characters must make a Skill Challenge using their Stakes Sheet.

&nbsp;

First, a character should describe how they're attempting to solve a problem. Based on that, the GM will determine two things: whether the roll is **Cautious** or **Bold** as well as what the **Stakes** are, shown below.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Stakes are, simply put, the good or bad things that can happen during a skill challenge. **Augments** tend to increase how much you succeed by, while **Dangers** are hazards and pitfalls that can occur along the way. The GM will first decide at least one automatic stake that happens regardless of the dice roll, whether that be an **Augment** or **Danger**. In addition, your GM will highlight a few potential **Dangers**, as well as what **Augments** may be relevant.
&nbsp;

Characters will then determine how many dice they roll. Players automatically roll 2 dice for this check, but may gain or lose die ones based on a variety of factors:
* If a character has appropriate Equipment for the situation, they gain an additional die.
* If a character has an appropriate Tag or their magic or spirit would be helpful, they gain an additional die, or two if it is an exceptionally good fit. This may trigger multiple times, up to a maximum of 3 die.
* If a character has done work to prepare for a situation or has set up some other advantage, they may gain a die.
* A character may take 1 **Stress** to gain an additional die. In some circumstances the GM may decide that the character must take 1 **Fatigue** instead, typically for checks that occur over a long timespan such as Travel.
* If a character has a condition that would hinder their ability to succeed, they may lose a die.

&nbsp;

At this point, a character may take 1 **Stress** to swap from Bold to Cautious, or vice versa. Additionally, if characters have abilities that allow them to modify the Stakes sheet, they may use them here.

&nbsp;

After determining the character's die pool, characters roll their d6s. A result of 1-2 is a &#8863;, a result of 3-4 is a &#9634;, and a result of 5-6 is a &#8862;. If acting **Cautiously**, characters reroll &#9634; and &#8862;, while if they are rolling **Boldly** they reroll &#8863; and &#9634;. If a character is rolling **Skillfully** (usually from some ability), they may reroll dice of their choice. If a character does not wish to reroll, they may take 1 **Stress** to use their initial result.

&nbsp;

After completing rolls, characters assign their available dice to Augments and Dangers. The GM then narrates the scene, applies appropriate consequences and conditions, and the adventure continues.

&nbsp;
### Using Spiritcraft
A character's Spirit Talents will outline the general guidelines of how a character's spiritcraft may be used. For checks that fit perfectly within these bounds characters may freely use their spiritcraft. However, in circumstances where characters are using their spiritcraft over an extended period or are pushing beyond the bounds of what their magic can accomplish a character must mark down 1 **Spirit**.

&nbsp;
### Group Checks
In many cases multiple party members may wish to attempt a skill challenge, or it may make narrative sense for the entire party to participate. In these cases, use the following rules:
* For each character beyond the first in a group check, add an additional **Danger**.
* All consequences of the challenge are distributed among all participating characters as evenly as possible.
* Choose one character as the lead for the skill check. They may contribute up to three dice from Tags, magic, or their spirit as normal, and may use abilities as normal.
* Each other character that has a relevant tag, magic, or spirit gain 1 die. For each character that has none, subtract 1 die.
* For an equipment bonus to apply, at least half the characters participating must have the appropriate equipment.
* Characters may gain Stress independently to add a die. Only one character must take Strain to change the party's approach or not reroll.

&nbsp;
### Abbreviated Skill Challenge
In general, characters should either be able to automatically do something, be unable to do something, or begin a Skill Challenge. However, in some situations, there might be a question of whether or not a character can succeed, but it isn't worth consulting an entire stakes sheet for the scenario. In such cases, a GM should determine how many &#8862; are needed to succeed, as well as a single penalty for failure. The character will create their dice pool as normal then roll, counting up the number of &#8862; they achieved. Characters do not reroll due to attempting something **Cautiously**, **Boldly**, or **Skillfully** in an Abbreviated Skill Challenge. If a character achieves enough &#8862; they succeed; otherwise, they fail.

&nbsp;
When a skill check is called for in combat, an Abbreviated Skill Challenge is always attempted. Typically, there is no penalty for failing beyond the resources spent to attempt this.

&nbsp;
### Narrative Resources

In narrative play characters must manage their Strain and Spirit gauges. The Strain gauge represents a character's physical health, while the Spirit gauge represents the same for a character's Spirit and magical capability. Each is comprised of 6 squares, with empty spaces representing available resources.
&nbsp;

A character's Spirit gauge represents their reserves of magic as well as the physical health of their spirit, which are represented by Fatgiue and Wounds. Spirits typically cannot recieve medical attention, and require the <u>Channel</u> _Camp Action_. If a spirit would gain Fatgiue but there is no space on the Spirit gauge, they instead replace a Fatigue with a Wound, as a character would.
&nbsp;

Common instances of the Spirit gauge are as follows:
* Participating in combat always causes 1 Fatigue.
* Using spirit abilities or pushing your limits (using an ability for an entire travel day, for example) may cause your Spirit to gain _Fatigue_.
* If a Spirit is manifested for the majority of a day of travel, they gain _Fatigue_.
* _Fatigue_ for your Spirit is a common stake for challenges.
* If a spirit assists you in in a challenge split **Injury** Dangers between the two of you.
* If your spirit falls in combat they take _Wounds_ as normal.
&nbsp;

If a character's Spirit gauge is ever filled they cannot use magic and their spirit is incapable of helping in tasks or combat, although they may still be manifested. A character may inflict Harm to be able to use their magic for a single scene.
&nbsp;

If a character's spirit gauge is full and is all Harm the character's spirit dies. The character loses all spiritcraft, and may not use magic ever again.

&nbsp;
A character's Strain gauge, however, tracks several potential conditions; Stress, Fatigue, and Wounds, as well as more specialized variants of those.
&nbsp;

* Stress represents a character's mental state. Stress is easy to gain and cannot typically be cleared simply through rest; it requires the assistance of allies and time to clear. Stress on its own has no impact, but can rapidly fill a character's Strain gauge.
* Fatigue is general physical ills caused from long hikes, combat, and the labors of adventuring. Fatigue can be cleared with sufficient rest. In combat, characters gain 1 _Stun_ for each Fatigue on their track at the start of the Round.
    * Hunger and Thirst are specialized subsets of Fatigue caused by not having enough to eat or drink. Rather than clearing with rest, these are instead cleared when the appropriate resources have been procured, although only one of each may be cleared per day.
* Wounds are the most serious of injuries, and represent distinct physical injuries. The severity of a wound is measured in the number of segments it takes up, with more segments corresponding to a worse wound. Each wound is bespoke and carries with it a Condition Clock, which must be full before the Wound can be downgraded to a Fatigue. Additionally, this Condition Clock will make certain skill challenges more difficult and inflict and appropriate status effect on the character at the start of each round of combat.
&nbsp;

If a character gains a condition and their gauge is full, instead upgrade the lowest rank effect in their Strain gauge to the next tier (Strain->Fatigue->Wound). If upgrading Strain or Fatigue, also inflict an appropriate Condition on the character with 2-4 segments. For example, if a character was forced to upgrade a Hunger to a Wound, they might gain the Condition 'Starving', and be unable to clear Hunger until that clock was full.

Common effects that fills the Strain gauge are as follows:
* Characters can take Stress to push themselves and gain additional effects on skill checks.
* Characters automatically gain 1 Fatigue when participating in combat and for each day of travel.
* If a character Falls in combat, they gain 1 Wound.
* If a character does not have food or water for a day they gain Hunger or Thirst, as appropriate.
