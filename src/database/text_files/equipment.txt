### Character Equipment
Characters need to carry weapons, armor, food, and various other supplies to survive in the Shattered World.

&nbsp;

### Equipment Slots
Inventory in Shattered Spirits is abstracted away to _Inventory Slots_, or simply _Slots_. Slots are a combination of the size and weight of an object, with heavier and bulkier objects taking up additional _Slots_. As a general rule, an item the size of a large knife or Potion is a single _Slot_, one-handed weapons and tools are 2 _Slots_, and two-handed weapons and equipment are 4 _Slots_.

&nbsp;
A character's inventory is divided up into their _Worn_ and _Packed_ items. A _Worn_ Item is easily accessible, and can be used in high-pressure or combat situations with no additional risks, while _Packed_ items are in a pack, secured, or otherwise inaccessible and require more effort to access. Some items, like Armor, must be in a _Worn_ slot to gain any benefit.

&nbsp;

Characters track _Worn_ and _Packed_ equipment seperately. Characters may carry up to 12 _Slots_ of Packed Equipment, and may carry a variable amount of _Worn_ equipment, which impacts their _Encumbrance_.

&nbsp;

### Encumbrance
Depending on how many equipment slots, characters will have a Light, Medium, or Heavy Load, which grants the following bonuses and penalties:
* **Light:** Characters with a Light Load may change any _Fatigue_ automatic stakes to a **Danger** during a Travel Roll, and gain +2 _Movement_ in combat.
* **Medium:** Characters with a Medium Load gain +1 _Movement_ in combat.
* **Heavy:** Characters with a Heavy Load create an additional _Fatigue_ **Danger** while traveling.

&nbsp;
A character's current _Load_ can also be called as a Condition when making a Skill Challenge; typically, a Medium Load will never cause a penalty or danger, while Light/Heavy loads can be called as a benefit penalty when a character's weight would influence the roll.
&nbsp;

Characters with a _Worn_ _Load_ of 5 or less have a _Light_ _Load_, 10 or less have a _Medium_, and 15 or less have a _Heavy_. Characters may not travel with a _Load_ greater than 15.
