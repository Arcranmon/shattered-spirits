### John and Temper
The current apprentice blacksmith of the town, John is kind, dutiful, and painfully shy. Even among the others his age in town John is a bit of an enigma, although Winona swears she has seen John practicing swordfighting in the forge at night. His is closest with Marlon, and absolutely terrified of Margaret.
&nbsp;

John has a wiry, rugged build, silvery hair, and three metallic mole-like growths beside either eye that are reminiscent of a spider's eyes. He tends to wear bland, ill-fitting clothes, and tends to proudly wear a sword he made himself across his back.
&nbsp;

John was adopted by Ruger, the town's blacksmith, and has spent more time in the forge than anybody his age should. He's good at what he does and would likely be content to do it for the rest of his life were it not for romantic notions of swordfighting intruding on that complacency. John struggles to connect with others, and has decided the persona of a skilled swordsman is the best way to overcome this shortcoming. By fully mastering the sword people will attribute unwarranted meaning to his awkward silences, need him for things beyond fixing a hoe and, most importantly, think he is the coolest guy in town. His peers have noticed, although not quite in the way he wanted; they're all more than a bit concerned that something has happened to John, as he's taken to resting his hand on the pommel of his sword, nodding, then abruptly leaving whenever somebody attempts to talk to him.
&nbsp;

Temper, John's companion, is a small metal spirit that is vaguely spider shaped, but is truthfully an orb with four legs, a series of black metallic eyes, and a stem-like growth coming out of the middle of its bulbous form. It can also extrude thin metal wire not unlike spidersilk, something that John and Ruger make endless use of in teh forge. It's an odd creature and more than slightly offputting in appearance, but is often seen on John's back like some sort of odd backpack. Temper loves to snack on things made of tin and hates birds.
