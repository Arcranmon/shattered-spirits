### John and Temper
<i>The current apprentice blacksmith of the town, John is kind, dutiful, and painfully shy. Even among the others his age in town, John is a bit of an enigma, although Winona swears she has seen John practicing swordfighting in the forge at night. John's spirit, Temper, takes the form of a large flightless beetle that can typically be found clinging to his back like a large metallic backpack.</i>
&nbsp;

**Virtue:** _Tough_
John is hardier than most due to his years working the forge, and can shrug off minor injuries, as well as take more punishment than most in combat. 
&nbsp;

**Background:** _Blacksmith_
John has worked in the forge for much of his life and is an expert at working with metal. John can assist at a blacksmith's, increasing the quality of the items they have available, and is adept at repairing equipment on the road. John's years in the blacksmith have made him exceptionally knowledgeable about metal, both raw and forged, strong biceps, and made him even more resilient.

**Talents:** 
* **Warm Smile:** John makes a good first impression when meeting new people; in general, characters will grant small favors for John without receiving anything in return. This also grants John a small bonus to a camp action that lets you help allies clear Stress.
* **Medic Training:** 

&nbsp;
**Martial Disciplines:**
* **Sword Master:** John specializes in using a sword, and is most comfortable with it in his hand. Whenever John attempts a Skill Challenge and is able to use a sword he may roll Skillfully. In addition, John gains _Basic Blade Arts_. 
* **Duelist:** blah blah bla

&nbsp;
**Spirit Disciplines:**
* **Basic Metal Arts:** John, like everyone bonded to a Metal spirit, can innately manipulate metals. Without further training, this  allows him to pull small metallic objects to himself, and allows John to manipulate metal a bit more easily, although harder metals are resistant to this.
* **Metal Grasp:** John has specialized his spiritcraft on pushing and pulling metal objects, granting him a fine control and much greater effects. John can control metal within about 50 feet of himself, and use craft to lift approximately 100 pounds of metal. The lighter the object John manipulates, the finer telekinetic control he has.

**Spirit:** BUG
