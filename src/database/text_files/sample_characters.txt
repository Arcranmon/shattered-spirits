### Sample Characters

The following characters all call Snake Village home, whether they grew up there or have recently joined. If you simply want to hop into an adventure, any of the below provide an excellent jumping off point.
&nbsp;

### Margaret and Cliff
<i>A relative rarity in the town, Margaret's family runs one of the oldest homesteads in Snake Village, reliably supplying much of the village with food. While she helps out when she is able to, Margaret chafes at the thought of being stuck on a farm and joins every away mission available. With a heavy hammer and Cliff, her vaguely dog-shaped spirit, she brings a strong back and reliable spiritcraft to adventuring parties.</i>

### Blaine and Tigris
<i>Blaine is one of the town's sages, which means he is tasked with keeping the Great Serpent complacent, while maintaining the knowledge of the ancient rites to accomplish that.</i>

&nbsp;

### John and Temper
<i>The current apprentice blacksmith of the town, John is kind, dutiful, and painfully shy. Even among the others his age in town, John is a bit of an enigma, although Winona swears she has seen John practicing swordfighting in the forge at night. John's spirit, Temper, takes the form of a large spider that can typically be found clinging to his back like a large metallic backpack.</i>
