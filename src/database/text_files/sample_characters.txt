### Sample Characters

The following characters all call Snake Village home, whether they grew up there or have recently joined. If you simply want to hop into an adventure, any of the below provide an excellent jumping off point.
&nbsp;

### John and Kit
*An apprentice smith and wannabe swordmaster with a metallic
The current apprentice blacksmith of the town, John is kind, dutiful, and painfully shy. Even among the others his age in town John is a bit of an enigma, although Winona swears she has seen John practicing swordfighting in the forge at night. His is closest with Marlon, and absolutely terrified of Margaret.
&nbsp;

John has a wiry, rugged build, silvery hair, and three metallic mole-like growths beside either eye that are reminiscent of a spider's eyes. He tends to wear bland, ill-fitting clothes, and tends to proudly wear a sword he made himself across his back.
&nbsp;
John was adopted by Ruger, the town's blacksmith, and has spent more time in the forge than anybody his age should. He's a capable smith and would likely be content to do it for the rest of his life were it not for romantic notions of swordfighting intruding on that complacency. John struggles to connect with others and has decided that mastering the blade is the best way to overcome this shortcoming.

&nbsp;
 If he becomes a master of the sword people will attribute meaning to his awkward silences, need him for things beyond horseshoes and hoes and, most importantly, think he is the coolest guy in town. His peers have noticed, although not quite in the way he wanted; they're all more than a bit concerned that something has happened to John; whenever somebody attempts to talk to him he's taken to resting his hand on the pommel of his sword, nodding, then abruptly leaving.
&nbsp;

Kit, John's companion, is a small metal spirit that is vaguely spider shaped, but is better described as an orb with four legs, a series of black metallic eyes, and a stem-like growth coming out of the middle of its bulbous form that almost forms a hat. It can also extrude thin metal wire not unlike spidersilk, something that John and Ruger make endless use of in the forge. It's an odd creature and more than slightly offputting in appearance, but is often seen on John's back like some sort of odd backpack. Kit loves to snack on things made of tin and hates birds.

### Erika, Vicki, and Belle
While she is technically the apprentice herbalist in Serpent Village, Erika is better known as a troublemaker and slacker within the town. She would much rather practice her sculptures or try to splice two random plants together than actually deal with the mundanity of work. She is very close with Winona (who constantly covers for her), and is constantly fighting with Blaine.
&nbsp;

Erika is rarely seen without flowers in her hair and covering slightly more of her clothing than might be considered reasonable. She exercises her craft easily and often, and constantly adorns herself with simple but impossible plant growths. In theory she would be a poor candidate for the town guard, but Vicki and Belle are so ferocious that they more than compensate for her generally calm demeanor. More importantly, almost all of the town guard shifts are exceptionally boring, providing an excellent opportunity to slack off.

&nbsp;
Despite her slacking, Erika has a (somewhat) noble goal: find a way to make a tree that can grow Dreamweed, grow that tree into an elegant and magnificent crown-shaped and giant-serpent-head-sized sculpture, and let the town relax a little bit more with The Great Serpent a bit more pacified. This is, of course, a long ways from completion and, at least for now, Erika would much rather relax and make friends within the village.
&nbsp;

Vicki and Belle are Erika's spirit; an antelope-like creature woven from bark and vines, covered in small vibrant flowers and berries and, naturally, has two heads. Erika is quite adamant that Vicki and Belle have distinct personalities and act differently, although nobody else in the town seems to be able to tell the difference. Vicki and Belle are incredibly friendly and can be found roaming the town at all times. They love children and sugar and hate cats.
