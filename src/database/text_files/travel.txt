### Traveling in the Shattered World
The Shattered World is a beautiful, wild, dangerous place, and travelers leaving the safety of their town or village must be well-prepared. Besides the obvious dangers of hunger, thirst, weather, and dangerous beasts, the Shattered World carries with it other, greater dangers, like impossible weather, territorial spirits and, of course, areas still ravaged by the Shattering itself.
&nbsp; 

### The Phases of a Journey
Play in Shattered Spirits is structured around the phases of a Journey. Each Journey represents a trip away from home, and is where the bulk of gameplay comes in.

&nbsp;

Before beginning a Journey, characters first have to find why they're going on a Journey! Common motivations are to find a rare resource or medicine, find a piece of lost knowledge, or to beg a boon from a distant spirit. Early on these motivations will likely be more concrete but, as the players explore the world and make bonds with NPCs, they may come up with journies that they wish to attempt.

&nbsp; 

Once a goal and destination are decided, characters will then break their Journey down into Legs, which represent the primary stops in the Journey. Some shorter Journies may only have a single Leg (journey origin to the final destination), but longer Journies will frequently be comprised of multiple Legs. Typically, each stop will be a place the party can rest, recuperate, and refresh themselves before the next destination. 

&nbsp; 

Once players have established their Legs, the GM will assign each a travel distance, which is tracked using a Clock, and create the appropriate Journey Decks. From there, players will play through travel days, making progress to their destination, finding discoveries, and dealing with every obstacle that comes in their way. At the start of each day, the GM will draw from the Event Deck for the current Leg to determine the day's weather and any major events, such as roaming spirits or other travelers.

&nbsp;

From there, the GM will lay out the days' Stakes, and the players will make their Travel Roll, play through the top card on the **Hazard Deck** (with increased effect if not uncovered) and anything uncovered from the **Exploration Deck**, then make camp for the night, rest, and prepare for the next day. Characters continue to make Travel Rolls until they have accumulated enough travel progress to fill the Clock, which indicates that they'll reach their goal on that day of travel. From there, the game plays as normal, with players overcoming the obstacles required to accomplish their goal or simply resting in a town to prepare for the next phase of travel. Once players reach their final goal and accomplish (or fail to accomplish) their task, the process begins again with the return journey to make it back home.

&nbsp;

### The Travel Roll
Each day when the party attempts to make progress to their destination they should make a Travel Roll, which is a specialized Skill Challenge. In general, characters don't get bonus dice for a travel roll except for abilities that specifically grant them. Most bonus dice will be granted by either knowledge of the route, such as experience or a detailed map, or a Talent that is granting a situational bonus.

&nbsp;

Like any Skill Challenge, the GM will first lay out the stakes, many of which are standardized for the Travel Roll, and players must decide if they are being **Bold** or **Cautious** in their travel. In almost every case, there will be two Automatic Stakes; **Speed**, which grants a single segment on the progress clock, and **Affliction**, which grants all traveling characters _Fatigue_. In general, all characters make their Travel roll seperately, although some Stakes may benefit the whole party or may be offset by a single character. In these cases, provide an additional stakes sheet that only has the **Dangers** and **Augments** for the whole party to simplify tracking whether those have been dealt with.

&nbsp;

While traveling, the following are common Stakes that the GM might use:

&nbsp;
**Dangers:**
* **Affliction:** In a dangerous areas with odd weather or terrain **Fatigue** or other afflictions might be a danger, although appropriate equipment may automatically remove those dangers automatically.
* **Delay:** In areas where navigation is difficult this Danger removes a segment from the Clock for the current Leg, after adding any **Speed** from the current one. A single character can offset this **Danger** for the whole party.
* **Expense:** In areas of extreme heat, characters must mark off a day of water of gain **Thirst**. Other, more exotic climates might require a different resource to navigate, such as antidotes in a toxic swamp.
* **Fatigue:** In particularly rough terrain characters might risk additional **Fatigue**.
* **Indiscretion:** This stake is usually present, and represents the party leaving a trail. A single character can offset this **Danger** for the whole party.
* **Menace:** Any dice placed on this **Danger** can be spent to see the next card in the **Hazard Deck**. This represents characters scouting out dangers and finding risks before they happen. The party can lose 1 progress on the **Travel Clock** to route around it, moving the card to the bottom of the **Hazard Deck**, or potentially dealing with it ahead of time.

&nbsp;

**Augments:**
* **Advantage:** You find a good site to camp for the night, lowering the burden for what equipment is required to get a sufficient rest.
* **Efficacy:** Choose a single Job to work on during this travel. Any die placed on this Job increase the effect. Many Talents provide additional jobs, but common ones are below:
    * **Aid:** You may give any die spent on this to other characters, who may immediately roll them and spend them on **Dangers**/**Augments** as appropriate.
    * **Chart:** Mark one segment on the Route Mastery Clock for this route. Only one character may choose this option per day, and only one segment may be placed on it.
    * **Forage:** For each die on this Job, roll a d6. Choose one, then get the appropriate result from this Route's **Forage Chart**.
    * **Hunt:** As **Forage**, but instead roll on the **Hunting Chart**.
* **Observation:** Each die on this **Augment** allows the party to draw a single card from the **Exploration Deck**, resolving its effect.

&nbsp;

When traveling, the total progress marked is the lowest progress that any party member achieved. This means that all characters must play the **Speed** Advantage the same number of times; be flexible with allowing players to rearrange how they spent their dice to make sure nobody gets left behind.

&nbsp;
While traveling, the standards for Equipment providing a bonus are significantly higher. Most relevant Equipment will specify its bonuses, such as automatically removing a Danger related to a specific effect.

&nbsp;
### Making Camp
After a long day of travel, the party will typically make camp. When they do, the party has a chance to decompress, gather themselves, and rest. When resting, each party member can do a single **Camp Action**, and then makes their **Rest Roll**.

&nbsp;

**Camp Actions** are all small things that need to be done around the camp, or can help a character properly recover. Each character can normally do one per Camp Phase. In general, basic tasks such as breaking camp, making a fire, and setting up tents are done without a character using their Camp Action. Common Camp Actions are as follows:
* **Channel:** You may only take this action if you have considerable _Source_ for your Spirit. Clear one _Fatigue_ on your _Spirit_, and when make your _Rest Roll_ you may heal your Spirit's _Wounds_ as if they had medical treatment. Alternatively, you may restore 1 _Durability_ to your spirit's _Armor_.
* **Cook:** Basic cooking is handled as a part of general camp actions (although appropriate tools and a fire may be required for some food), but characters can't benefit from any bonuses granted by the food. If a character takes the time to cook the party benefits from any bonuses granted by the food, which can often help clear **Stress** in the party. This action requires Cooking Tools and a fire.
* **Cover:** You take the time to hide traces of the camp, which may provide an Advantage.
* **Forage/Hunt:** As the options during the Travel, but you roll only a single die.
* **Mend:** Choose a piece of Equipment that is missing _Durability_ but not _Destroyed_. Spend 2 _Scrap_ of the same material to restore 1 _Durability_. Only one character can target the same item, and this requires the appropriate tools for working with that material.
* **Patch:** Mark off a medicine. You or another character roll an additional die on your _Rest Roll_, and may immediately mark one segment on an Injury Clock. A character may only benefit from this once per Camp.
* **Rest:** Roll an additional die on your _Rest Roll_ and clear 1 _Stress_.
* **Secure:** You take the time to fortify the camp, which may provide an Advantage.
* **Vent:** Choose another character; the two of you roleplay a quick scene; afterwards, both of you clear 1 **Stress**.


&nbsp;

After finishing their Camp Action, characters will mark off one Water and one Food or take the appropriate conditions, then make a **Rest Roll** to see how well they're able to recover. The **Rest Roll** typically has an automatic Stake of a single **Efficacy**, and often includes the following:

&nbsp;
**Dangers**
* **Affliction:** You sleep far too heavily, leaving you unaware to any dangers for the night.

&nbsp;
**Augments**
* **Efficacy:** Remove an additional **Fatigue**, restore 1 on your Spirit Track, or mark one segment on an Injury Clock.

&nbsp;

If characters are unable to get a quality rest either due to not finding a sufficiently safe place to camp or missing essential equipment such as bedrolls or tents they take a 1 die penalty on their roll. If conditions are sufficiently poor characters may also gain **Stress**. Characters always roll their **Rest Roll** **Cautiously**, unless they are specifically at a Haven or other similarly safe location.

### Travel Pace
All the above rules assume a normal travel pace. Characters may make the following changes to their Travel/Rest for the following effects:
* **Casual Pace:** Lose the automatic **Speed** stake, but roll +1 die on your **Travel Roll**.
* **Forced March:** Gain an additional automatic **Speed** stake. Take an additional **Fatigue**, and roll -1 die on your **Travel Roll**.
* **Double Shift:** While Making Camp, you may take an additional Camp Action. You may not do the **Rest** Camp Action tonight. Additionally, you lose the automatic **Efficacy** stake when resting, and roll -1 die.
