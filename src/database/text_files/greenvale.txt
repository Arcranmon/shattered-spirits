### The Greenvale

Named as such for its lush greenery and relative safety within the Shattered World, Greenvale is the closest things to a peaceful region that can be found. Located on a wide peninsula and cut off from the rest of the continent by a mountain range that seems to reach the sky, the Greenvale is spared the worst of rampaging spirits.
&nbsp;
That is not, to say, that the Greenvale is without its dangers. Thick forests cover much of the peninsula, and the creatures within do not take kindly to wanderers. The plenty of the land has lead to more settlements than other regions and, with them, conflict between the various groups. A true pillaging or invasion would risk the wrath of a town's Guardian, but homesteaders and others that live outside the proper bounds of a village must remain ever vigilant not only against the threat of other spirits, but also raiders from the less scrupulous villages.
