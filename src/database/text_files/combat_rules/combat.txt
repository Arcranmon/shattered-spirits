### Basic Rules
The following basic rules always hold true:
1. Round up.
2. You are not your own ally.
3. Specific overrides general.
4. When a '/' separates things read it as 'or'. The user may choose any of the options listed and in any combination.

&nbsp;
### Rounds in Shattered Spirits
Combat in Shattered Spirits is split up into _Rounds_, _Phases_, and _Turns_.

&nbsp;
A _Round_ is a complete cycle of combat, where each _Phase_ is completed.

&nbsp;
A _Phase_ is a collection of _Turns_ that are all occurring at a similar time within the _Round_.

&nbsp;
A _Turn_ is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various _Techniques_ to influence the battle.

&nbsp;
A _Round_ is structured as follows:
**Respite:** The start of each _Round_. This is not a _Phase_, and no Abilities are used. During Respite, resolve the following in the following order:
* Change your current _Stance_, if desired.
* Choose one:
    * May _Manifest_ your Spirit at an appropriate _Source_ within their _Manifest Range_, or pay 1 _Momentum_ to _Manifest_ them at _Melee_ Range. They become _Engaged_ with any creatures at said _Source_. They gain 2 _Momentum_. You may not choose this option if _Supressed_.
    * You may _Recall_ or choose to not _Manifest_ your _Spirit_. If you are not _Supressed_, gain 2 _Momentum_.
* Resolve any other effects that occur during _Respite_, typically field effects or other such abilities.

&nbsp;
**Phase 1-6:** These numbered Phases show the passing of time in combat and are when most action will take place. Each character's _Stance_ has a listed Speed, which is the _Phase_ that character takes their _Turn_ in. Any _Summoned_ Spirits also act at their listed _Speed_.

&nbsp; 
**End of Round:** The end of the Round. Many effects resolve in this window.

&nbsp;
An individual _Phase_ is divided into _Turns_. Within a _Phase_, all players go, then all enemies for that _Phase_.

&nbsp;

### Turns in Shattered Spirits
On **their** _Turn_, a character may do the following:
* Spend any amount of _Movement_.
* Use any number of _Abilities_. A given _Ability_ may only be used once per _Turn_ unless it has the _Repeatable_ keyword.
* Make a single _Attack_. Some _Stances_ remove this limit.

&nbsp;
Additionally, on **all** _Turns_ (including their own), creatures may do the following:
* Use any number of _Reactions_. A given _Reaction_ can only be used once per _Turn_ unless specified otherwise, and only one _Reaction_ may be used against a specific trigger.
* Use any number of _Gambits_, when applicable.

&nbsp;

### Making Attacks
Attacks in Shattered Spirits have a chart outlining damage and effects for values from 2-12. To make an Attack, you must first make an _Attack Roll_. Roll 2d6 and reference the chart in the Attack, using the Damage and Status in that row to resolve the Attack. For example, [redo this]. 

&nbsp;
**Advantage and Disadvantage:** Sometimes Attacks will have _Advantage_ or _Disadvantage_. An Attack with either rolls 3d6 instead of the normal 2d6. If the Attack has _Advantage_ the attacker resolves the attack with two dice of their choice (typically the highest), while _Disadvantage_ uses the lowest two rolls. If an Attack has both _Advantage_ and _Disadvantage_ they offset one another at a 1-to-1 rate. If an Attack has multiple instances of _Advantage_/_Disadvantage_ any additional instances are instead converted to a _Bonus_/_Penalty_.
&nbsp;

**Calculating Damage:** When determining how much damage is dealt to a creature, use the following order:
1. Determine the base Damage, as defined by the Attack or other effect.
2. Add any modifiers from Status Effects, such as _Impaired_ or _Exposed_.
3. Apply _Guard_.
4. Apply _Glancing_.

**Resolving Attacks:** When resolving the effects of an Attack, deal all Damage prior to resolving any Status. Additionally, the Target of an Attack should be aware of the Damage and Status that would be inflicted prior to using Reactions.

&nbsp;

**Extreme Rolls:** There are a variety of Reactions and other effects that can influence Attack Rolls, such as the Deflect Basic Skill, which reduces an _Attack Roll_ by 1. Whenever these are applied, resolve them using the modified _Attack Roll_. If an _Attack Roll_ ever ends up above a 12 or below a 2, special circumstances occur:
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is above a 12:</ins> Resolve the Attack using the 12 Result.
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is below 2:</ins> The Attack Misses.

&nbsp;
**Range:** Attacks in Shattered Spirits will have a Range of _Self_, _Melee_, and _Short_, _Medium_, and _Long Range_. 
* Self-Range effects either only affect the user. 
* Melee effects may only target creatures you are _Engaged_ with.
* Close-Range effects may target within your Arena.
* Short-Range effects may target within an adjacent Arena.
* Long-Range effects may target two Arenas away.

&nbsp;
### Resources in Combat

* **HP:** A representation of a character's stamina and vitality. When this bar is emptied, the character gains a _Wound_.
* **Stun:** A representation of a character's ability to defend themself. When full, any additional _Stun_ inflicted is convereted to Damage.
* **Momentum:** 
* **Movement:** A resource representing how mobile a character is, and how much they can move about the battlefield. Characters may always spend _Movement_ in the following ways on their _Turn_:
    * 1 _Movement_: If not _Engaged_, become _Engaged_ with a creature in your _Arena_.
    * 1 _Movement_: Remove _Engaged_ as well as any _Terrain Bonus_ or _Hazard_ you have.
    * 1 _Movement_: If not _Engaged_, move to an adjacent _Arena_.
    * 1 _Movement_: Gain a _Hazard_ or _Terrain Bonus_. You automatically become _Engaged_ with any other creatures benefiting from the same effect.
    * 1 _Movement_: If not _Engaged_, take a specific position within your _Arena_, the effects of which should be resolved with your GM. For example, you might move to guard a piece of unattended Equipment, which would require that any creature that wants to grab it become _Engaged_ with you.

&nbsp;

### Arenas and Movement
Combat in Shattered Spirits doesn't make use of a traditional combat grid; instead, it is abstracted away into Arenas. To help demonstrate these concepts, a complex combat map has been provided as an example.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
<img :src="$map" style="width: 40em; border: 2px solid black;"/>
</div>

&nbsp;
Arenas are the basic layout of the combat map, and represent distinct areas in a battlefield, with your typical combat consisting of 6-10 Arenas. Each Arena typically represents a distinct and prominent terrain feature (such as the **Steep Cliffs** or **Underground River** on the above map) or is simply used to demonstrate a large amount of distance (such as splitting the **Cave Entrance** and the **Cave Center**). Characters may spend 1 _Movement_ to move to an adjacent _Arena_.

&nbsp;
 On the above map, the **Cave Entrance**, **Underground River**, **Side Tunnel Entrance**, **Cave Center**, **Steep Cliffs**, **High Ground**, **Egg Storage**, **Narrow Tunnel**, and **Queen's Lair** are the relevant Arenas, each with their own distinct effects, as outlined below (all WIP and mostly to illustrate how things work).

&nbsp;
* **Cave Entrance** [Earth, Retreat] - This Arena is uneventful with no significant Positions. The [Earth] keyword denotes that this Arena is primarily made of that material (relevant for spirit abilities) while the Retreat keyword denotes that, if the party wishes to flee, they must all be within this Arena. The **Cave Entrance** is connected to the **Underground River**, **Cave Center**, and **Steep Cliffs**.
* **Cave Center** [Earth] - Another simple Arena, this one has the **Large Stalactite** Terrain. Characters 
    * **Large Stalactite** [Earth] - Creatures at the same Position as this receive [_Cover_].
* **Underground River** [Water, Swimming, Rushing 2] - This Arena is a rushing river of water, and as such has the [Water] keyword rather than Earth. Because of the [Swimming] keyword, characters must _Swim_ when entering or leaving this Arena; for most creatures, this means that all Movement costs are increased by 1, and they gain the _Paddinged_ condition upon doing any Movement here. Finally, the [Rushing 2] keyword designates the flow of the river here; characters that end a _Phase_ in this Arena gain 2 _Stun_. There is one unique _Position_ in this Arena that has the **Bridge** Terrain.
    * **Bridge** [Earth, Path] - This Terrain has the Path keyword, which means it is exempt from the [Swimming, Rushing 2] keywords of the rest of the Arena. Characters can use this Position to safely cross the **Underground River** without having to swim. This Terrain can be destroyed by dealing sufficient damage to it or with powerful [Earth] abilities. At the end of the Turn this Terrain is Destroyed, all creatures on it fall into a new Position in the **Underground River**.
* **Side Tunnel Entrance** [Earth] - On the other side of the **Underground River** is the **Side Tunnel Entrance**. This Arena is notable for its **Side Tunnel** Terrain, which is its own Position.
    * **Side Tunnel** [Earth, Reinforcements] - This piece of Terrain will create new enemies at the start of each _Round_ after the 1st. Similar to the Bridge, it can be destroyed with a powerful attack or [Earth] effect.

&nbsp;

### Hit Points and Wounds
* <ins>Hit Points (HP)</ins> represents a character's ability to defend themselves. While a character has _HP_ they are taking little damage; they are narrowly avoiding attacks, shrugging off blows, or otherwise taking superficial damage. When a character loses all their _HP_ they roll for _Wounds_, reset their hp to full, then take any remaining Damage. Characters typically start combat encounters with full _HP_.
* <ins>Vigor</ins> represents a character's fighting spirit and sudden surges of energy in battle, and is typically only gained in combat. Vigor is always lost before _HP_. _Vigor_ does not stack; if a character would gain _Vigor_ while they already have it they must choose whether to keep their current amount of _Vigor_ or replace it with the value they would gain.
* <ins>Stun</ins> is a character's mental and physical state, as well as their composure. Characters start at 0 _Stun_. When a character's total _Stun_ is equal to their maximum _Stun_ any additional inflicted _Stun_ is converted to Damage.
* <ins>Wounds</ins> occur when a character is _Downed_. 
* <ins>Downed</ins> occurs when a creature's _HP_ reaches 0. For most NPCs, this means they are immediately _Defeated_. Player characters and more powerful NPCs instead roll for _Wounds_. Characters roll a number of d6s equal to their current number of _Wounds_ (2d6 and keep the lower if 0), then gain a _Wound_ with segments equal to half the result. After gaining _Wounds_ a character is reset to full _HP_, then takes any overflow damage. If a character has _Armor_, they may choose to _Sunder_ it to take _Fatigue_ in place of a _Wound_, with each _Sunder_ reducing one _Wound_. In addition, if they used a _Block_ against the triggering effect, they may _Sunder_ a _Wielded_ piece of _Equipment_ as if it was Armor.
* <ins>Spirit Downed</ins> occurs when a character's spirit's _HP_ reaches 0. When a _Spirit_ is _Downed_ that character becomes _Suppressed_ for the remainder of the _Round_ (or _Sealed_ if they are already _Suppressed_). Additionally, the spirit rolls for _Harm_, using the same rules as a player rolling for _Wounds_. After gainin _Harm_ the _Spirit_ is reset to full _HP_, then takes any overflow damage.
* <ins>Death</ins>: It is extremely rare for a character to be killed in combat in Shattered Spirits. Characters only die when their entire Strain Meter is full of _Wounds_.

&nbsp;  

### Open and Hidden Information
**Open Information**: Players should <ins>always</ins> have access to the following information, either openly or by asking the Spirit Master:
* The victory condition for the current encounter.
* An approximation of a creature's _HP_ to the closest 25%.
* What _Statuses_ and _Afflictions_ a creature is currently suffering from.
* When/how any _Hazards_ on the battlefield will trigger, and the approximate consequence for doing so (i.e., 'you will be hit by an attack that might inflict _Shocked_').
* Once _Plotting_ is complete, what _Phase_ all creatures are acting in.
&nbsp;

**Almost-Open Information:** Players should learn the following information after damaging a creature or applying an _Affliction_ or _Status_:
* If any damage they dealt was _Resisted_.
* The Target's _Guard_.
* How much _Stamina_ that creature has remaining.
&nbsp;

**Hidden Information:** Players should not know the following information unless a _Technique_ reveals it and, additionally, the Spirit Master should not know the following information about player characters unless an ability reveals it:
* A creature's exact, current _HP_.
* The creature's current _Stances_, and what benefits they have.

&nbsp;

### Equipment in Combat
In combat, characters' equipment is defined by what they have _Worn_ and what they have _Wielded_.
&nbsp;

_Worn_ items are anything in a character's _Worn_ slots. A character's _Armor_, any consumable items, and any _Weapons_ stowed on their consumables are common examples of _Worn_ items.
&nbsp;

_Wielded_ items, on the other hand, are items that characters actively are using, typically by holding it in a hand. One-Handed items require a single hand to _Wield_, while Two-Handed items require both.
&nbsp;

If a character does not have an item _Wielded_ in a hand, that hand is considered an _Open Hand_.
&nbsp;

**Equipment and Open Hands:** In some cases Equipment must be _Wielded_ in two hands or gets additional benefits when _Wielded_ in such a way. In cases such as this, when a character is _Wielding_ a single piece of Equipment, they may choose on each _Turn_ if they are _Wielding_ it in one or both hands, but may not use it unless it is _Wielded_ in the appropriate number of hands.
&nbsp;

### Miscellaneous
* If the Cost of an ability is reduced to less than 0, any remaining reduction may (and should) be used on Boosts.
* For _Status_:
    * When Statuses react with an effect, ignore all _Weakness_/_Resistance_ and similar from said Status when resolving the reaction.
    * A Statuses reaction may not trigger another of its own Reactions.
    * If a negatable Status is added to an Attack that already afflicts it use the new DC if it is higher or instead increase the _Negate_ DC by half of the new statuses value For example, if _Push_ [4 _Grit_] was added to an Attack with _Push_ [5 _Grit_], it would instead inflict _Push_ [7  _Grit_].
