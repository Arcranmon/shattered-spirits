### Basic Rules
The following basic rules always hold true:
1. Round up unless specified otherwise.
2. When a '/' separates things read it as 'or'. The user may choose any of the options listed and in any combination.
3. You are not your own ally.

&nbsp;
### Rounds in Shattered Spirits
Combat in Shattered Spirits is split up into _Rounds_, _Phases_, and _Turns_. A _Round_ is a complete cycle of combat, where each _Phase_ is completed. A _Phase_ is a collection of _Turns_ that are all occurring at a similar speed in combat. A _Turn_ is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various _Techniques_ to influence the battle.
&nbsp;
A _Round_ is structured as follows:
**Respite:** The start of each _Round_. This is not a _Phase_, and no Techniques are used. During Respite, resolve the following in the following order:
* In every Round except the first, lose half of your current _Momentum_.
* You may Wield a piece of Equipped Equipment, or Equip a Wielded piece of Equipment.
* Reset your Movement to its maximum value, then clear _Stun_ and gain _Momentum_ as dictated by your _Stance_.
* Resolve any other effects that occur during _Respite_, typically from your _Stance_.

&nbsp;
**Phase 1-4:** These numbered Phases show the passing of time in combat and are when most _Actions_ will take place. _Phases_ are resolved in order, 1-4, with Phase 1 representing the fastest abilities and Phase 4 representing the slowest.

&nbsp; 
**End of Round:** The end of the Round. Many effects resolve in this window.

&nbsp;
An individual _Phase_ is divided into _Turns_. Within a _Phase_, players and enemies will alternate who acts. Typically, players get to act first in the first Phase of combat; after that, the first to act in the next _Phase_ is always the opposite of whatever group finished the current _Phase_. For example, if a player acts last in Phase 2, an enemy gets to act first in Phase 3.
&nbsp;
Whenever it is the player's _Turn_  a character may spend as much _Movement_ as they wish, use any _Stunts_, and use a single _Action_.

&nbsp;

### Turns in Shattered Spirits
On **their** _Turn_, a character may do the following:
* Use an _Action_.
* Spend any amount of _Movement_.
* Use any number of _Stunts_. A given _Stunt_ may only be used once per _Turn_ unless it has the _Repeatable_ keyword.
&nbsp;

Additionally, on **all** _Turns_ (including their own), creatures may do the following:
* Use any number of _Reactions_. A given _Reaction_ can only be used once per _Turn_ unless specified otherwise, and only one _Reaction_ may be used against a specific trigger.
* Use any number of _Gambits_, when applicable.

&nbsp;

### Making Attacks
Attacks in Shattered Spirits have a chart outlining damage and effects for values from 2-12. To make an Attack, you must first make an _Attack Roll_. Roll 2d6 and reference the chart in the Attack, using the Damage and Status in that row to resolve the Attack. For example, [redo this]. 

&nbsp;
**Advantage and Disadvantage:** Sometimes Attacks will have _Advantage_ or _Disadvantage_. An Attack with either rolls 3d6 instead of the normal 2d6. If the Attack has _Advantage_ the attacker resolves the attack with two dice of their choice (typically the highest), while _Disadvantage_ uses the lowest two rolls. If an Attack has both _Advantage_ and _Disadvantage_ they offset one another at a 1-to-1 rate. If an Attack has multiple instances of _Advantage_/_Disadvantage_ any additional instances are instead converted to a _Bonus_/_Penalty_.
&nbsp;

**Calculating Damage:** When determining how much damage is dealt to a creature, use the following order:
1. Determine the base Damage, as defined by the Attack or other effect.
2. Add any modifiers from Status Effects, such as _Impaired_ or _Exposed_.
3. Apply _Glancing_.
[redo this section as well]
5. Apply _Guard_.

**Resolving Attacks:** When resolving the effects of an Attack, deal all Damage prior to resolving any Status. Additionally, the Target of an Attack should be aware of the Damage and Status that would be inflicted prior to using Reactions.

&nbsp;

**Extreme Rolls:** There are a variety of Reactions and other effects that can influence Attack Rolls, such as the Deflect Basic Skill, which reduces an _Attack Roll_ by 1. Whenever these are applied, resolve them using the modified _Attack Roll_. If an _Attack Roll_ ever ends up above a 12 or below a 2, special circumstances occur:
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is above a 12:</ins> Resolve the Attack using the 12 Result. Deal an additional 2 Damage (if any) and add _Dazed_ 1.
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is below 2:</ins> The Attack Misses.

&nbsp;
**Range:** Attacks in Shattered Spirits will have a Range of _Self_, _Melee_, and _Short_, _Medium_, and _Long Range_. 
* Self-Range effects either only affect the user, or are centered on them. 
* Melee effects may only target within your Position.
* Short-Range effects may target within your Arena that are not at your _Position_.
* Reach effects my target any creature within your Arena.
* Medium-Range effects may target within an adjacent Arena.
* Long-Range effects may target within Arenas that are two Paths away.

&nbsp;


### Movement and the Combat map
The Combat Map in Shattered Spirits is comprised of _Arenas_, _Paths_, and _Positions_.

&nbsp;
The primary unit of this is the _Arena_, which are distinct locations that combat takes place in. Any number of characters can be in an _Arena_ at the same time.

&nbsp;
Connecting _Arenas_ are _Paths_, which show the ways that Arenas are connected to one another. These typically list a simple _Move_ cost to go from one to another, but may have more complicated conditions such as Terrain effects.

&nbsp;
_Positions_ represent where characters are in a given _Arena_. Characters at the same _Position_ are all within Melee range of one another and may _Occupy_ _Features_ at said _Position_.

&nbsp;
Characters have a number of Moves, which they may spend in combat. When a character uses a Technique or takes their Action they will be given a set number of Moves for that ability but may also spend Moves from their Move Pool. 

&nbsp;
Characters may always spend Moves to do one of the following:
* Move to a different Arena, paying the listed Move cost for the Path. This creates an _Opening_.
* Spend 1 _Move_ to join a _Position_ or establish a new one. If there is an unoccupied _Feature_ at said _Position_, the creature may _Occupy_ it. This creates an _Opening_.
* Spend 1 _Move_ to _Occupy_ a _Feature_ at your current _Position_.

&nbsp;
_Techniques_ and Actions may provide their own pool of Movement for the character to use that is lost at the end of the _Turn_. All other _Moves_ a character makes must come from their Move pool, which is 2, but may be adjusted by Stances and Equipment.

&nbsp;

### Health and Wounds
* <ins>Health</ins> represents a character's ability to defend themselves. While a character has _Health_ they are taking little damage; they are narrowly avoiding attacks, shrugging off blows, or otherwise taking superficial damage. When a character loses all their _Health_ they roll for _Wounds_, then increment their _Downed_ tracker. Characters typically start combat encounters with full _Health_.
* <ins>Vigor</ins> represents a character's fighting spirit and sudden surges of energy in battle, and is typically only gained in combat. Vigor is always lost before _Health_. _Vigor_ does not stack; if a character would gain _Vigor_ while they already have it they must choose whether to keep their current amount of _Vigor_ or replace it with the value they would gain.
* <ins>Stun</ins> is a character's mental and physical state, as well as their composure. Characters start at 0 _Stun_. When a character's total _Stun_ is equal to or greater than their maximum _Stun_ amount they immediately become _Stunned_ and reset their _Stun_ to 0.
* <ins>Wounds</ins> occur when a character is _Downed_. 
* <ins>Downed</ins> occurs when a creature's _Health_ reaches 0. For most NPCs, this means they are immediately _Defeated_. Player characters and more powerful NPCs instead roll for _Wounds_, which is done by rolling a number of d6s based on the number of times they have been _Downed_ prior to this. After gaining _Wounds_ a character is reset to full _Health_.
    * [redo]
* <ins>Spirit Downed</ins> occurs when a character's spirit's _Health_ reaches 0. When a _Spirit_ is _Downed_ that character becomes _Suppressed_ for the remainder of the _Round_ (or _Sealed_ if they are already _Suppressed_). Additionally, the spirit marks one against their _Spirit Track_. At the start of the next_Phase_ the spirit is reset to full _Health_.
* <ins>Death</ins>: It is extremely rare for a character to be killed in combat in Shattered Spirits. Characters only die when their entire Strain Meter is full of _Wounds_.
&nbsp;  

### Open and Hidden Information
**Open Information**: Players should <ins>always</ins> have access to the following information, either openly or by asking the Spirit Master:
* The victory condition for the current encounter.
* An approximation of a creature's _Health_ to the closest 25%.
* What _Statuses_ and _Afflictions_ a creature is currently suffering from.
* When/how any _Hazards_ on the battlefield will trigger, and the approximate consequence for doing so (i.e., 'you will be hit by an attack that might inflict _Shocked_').
* Once _Plotting_ is complete, what _Phase_ all creatures are acting in.
&nbsp;

**Almost-Open Information:** Players should learn the following information after damaging a creature or applying an _Affliction_ or _Status_:
* If any damage they dealt was _Resisted_.
* The Target's _Guard_.
* How much _Stamina_ that creature has remaining.
&nbsp;

**Hidden Information:** Players should not know the following information unless a _Technique_ reveals it and, additionally, the Spirit Master should not know the following information about player characters unless an ability reveals it:
* What _Techniques_ a creature is using (before the creature resolves said _Techniques_).
* A creature's exact, current _Health_.
* The creature's current _Stances_, and what benefits they have.

&nbsp;

### Equipment in Combat
In combat, characters' equipment is defined by what they have _Equipped_ and what they have _Wielded_.
&nbsp;

_Equipped_ items are simply anything that a character is wearing. If it is in their inventory, it is typically considered _Equipped_. A character's _Armor_, any consumable items, and any _Weapons_ stowed on their consumables are common examples of _Equipped_ items.
&nbsp;

_Wielded_ items, on the other hand, are items that characters actively are using, typically by holding it in a hand. One-Handed items require a single hand to _Wield_, while Two-Handed items require both.
&nbsp;

If a character does not have an item _Wielded_ in a hand, that hand is considered an _Open Hand_.
&nbsp;

**Equipment and Open Hands:** In some cases Equipment must be _Wielded_ in two hands or gets additional benefits when _Wielded_ in such a way. In cases such as this, when a character is _Wielding_ a single piece of Equipment, they may choose on each _Turn_ if they are _Wielding_ it in one or both hands, but may not use it unless it is _Wielded_ in the appropriate number of hands.
&nbsp;

### Miscellaneous
* If the Cost of an ability is reduced to less than 0, any remaining reduction may be used on Boosts.
* For _Status_:
    * When Statuses react with an effect, ignore all _Weakness_/_Resistance_ and similar from said Status when resolving the reaction.
    * A Statuses reaction may not trigger another of its own Reactions.
    * If a negatable Status is added to an Attack that already afflicts it use the new DC if it is higher or instead increase the _Negate_ DC by half of the new statuses value For example, if _Push_ [4 _Grit_] was added to an Attack with _Push_ [5 _Grit_], it would instead inflict _Push_ [7  _Grit_].
