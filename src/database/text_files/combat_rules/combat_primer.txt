Combat in Shattered Spirits is a mix of carefully planned abilities and sudden, spur-of-the-moment decision making. Every _Round_ begins with a _Respite_, a brief pause in the lull of combat before it resumes. Players can use this time to strategize for the coming round, and many battlefield effects will trigger at Respite.

&nbsp;

At this point the round of combat begins. Before the start of each _Phase_, characters select their Stance. After all Stances are selected, _Phase_ 1 begins!. Players and enemies alternate acting, resolving Abilities until a _Phase_ is complete, players can change their Stances before the next Phase, and another begins. Once _Phase_ 4 is over _Respite_ starts and the next _Round_ begins! 

&nbsp;

In each _Phase_, characters gain _Momentum_ and _Essence_ equal to the current _Phase_. _Momentum_ is used for a variety of mundane effects, such as _Movement_ and physical attacks, while _Essence_ is used for spirit abilities. Any unused _Momentum_ or _Essence_ is lost at the end of the _Phase_, so make sure to try to end the _Phase_ with no _Momentum_!

&nbsp;

Abilities are largely split up into a few main categories:
* _Attacks_ are abilities that focus on defeating or debuffing foes. Attacks may be used at any point on your _Turn_, although you may only use one on your _Turn_.
* _Maneuvers_ are special abilities that characters can use on their _Turn_. These are abilities like _Run_, which allows you to move further, or _Manifest_, which allows you to summon your Spirit. A character can use any number of _Manuevers_ on their _Turn_, but a given _Manuever_ can only be used once per _Turn_.
* _Reactions_ are abilities that can be used at any time. These are powerful defensive abilities like _Brace_, as well as things that allow you to punish foes, such as _Opportunity Attack_. Characters may use any number of _Reactions_, but a specific Trigger may only prompt a single _Reaction_.
* _Gambits_ are specialized abilities that enhance Attacks. Whenever a character rolls doubles or rolls a _Critical Hit_ they may apply a _Gambit_, or apply two if both conditions are true.

&nbsp;

In combat there are a few main resources that a character must manage:
* _Momentum_ is a character's primary mechanism for doing more in combat. Most _Stunts_, _Reactions_, _Gambits_, and many Attacks cost _Momentum_. _Momentum_ is gained from your _Stances_ during _Respite_, by abilities such as _Focus_, and by missing Attacks.
* _Movement_ is used by characters to traverse the battlefield and fuel high-mobility abilities. Characters have a small pool of _Movement_ that they may spend whenever it is their _Turn_. Additionally, many _Techniques_ and _Actions_ will provide additional _Movement_ that a character may use.
* _Stamina_ is a character's primary defensive resource, which can be spent to fuel defensive Reactions and ensure a character's survival.
* _Health_ is a measure of a character's current Health in combat. If a character's _Health_ hits 0 they aren't immediately defeated; instead, they gain _Wounds_ which make continuing combat more difficult.
* _Vigor_ is a pool of pseudo-Health that is always lost prior to _Health_. _Vigor_ never stacks; a character must either gain nothing or replace their current value when they would gain _Vigor_.

&nbsp;

Shattered Spirits uses a zone-based combat system where rather than a battlemap consisting of hexes or spaces there are simply different areas, called Arenas, where combatants can be. Each _Arena_ represents a distinct environment in the battlefield with its own terrain and hazards.

&nbsp;

Within each _Arena_ are a number of _Positions_, which represent the approximate positioning of characters and objects within said _Arena_. Most _Arenas_ can have any number of _Positions_, and it typically takes only a single _Movement_ to move between _Positions_.

&nbsp;

The avenues between _Arenas_ are called _Paths_ and represent the distance and hazards in between different _Arenas_. It always takes at least one _Movement_ to move between _Arenas_, although it typically costs more due to environmental effects.

&nbsp;

Range is based on the number of _Arenas_. _Melee_ effects can be used at your _Position_, while _Short_ Range may target anything in your _Arena_ that is not at your _Position_. _Reach_ Range may target any creature within your _Arena_. _Medium_ Range may target within an adjacent _Arena_, and _Long_ Range may target two _Arenas_ away. Effects may ONLY use their listed Range; a _Short_ Range effect could not target something at your _Position_, for example.

&nbsp;

Finally, characters need to carefully manage their _Sources_ and ensure that they don't fall victim to a condition that makes it difficult to use their spirit powers! 
* Flamebound act as _Suppressed_ when _Paddinged_ or at a _Position_ with _Water_ _Terrain_, and _Sealed_ when _Swimming_ in Water.
* Earthbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user has no _Source_ at their _Position_, and _Sealed_ when there is no _Source_ in their _Arena_ or the user is _Flying_.
* Waterbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user is _Alight_, and _Sealed_ if there is no _Source_ in any adjacent _Area_.
* Windbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user is underground and _Sealed_ when the user is fully encased in _Earth_, such as when _Restrained_ by an _Earth_ Ability.

&nbsp;

Combat typically continues until the players succeed or fail their objective for the battle. This can be something as simple as defeating all their enemies or more complicated, such as holding specific objectives on the battlefield for a set duration. Your Spirit Master will explain how to win at the beginning of combat, as well as answer any rules questions that you may have during the battle. Good luck, and may you and your spirit find success on the battlefield!
