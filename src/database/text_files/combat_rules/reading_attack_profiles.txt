 A Profile is what is used to determine the effectiveness of an attack. It is comprised of two or three columns: _Hit_,  Damage, and Status.
* **Hit** shows whether an Attack is a _Miss_,  _Graze_,  _Hit_,  or _Crit_. This column will always show 2-12, with a color code to show the effectiveness. When you Attack, simply consult the _Hit_ column and resolve the Attack using that row.
    * Red means a _Miss_ which, in general, means that no effect happens with the attack.
    * Yellow means a _Graze_, which is typically a minor effect that rarely inflicts Status.
    * Green means a _Hit_, representing a solid hit, which deals a good amount of damage and typically inflicts Status.
    * Purple means a _Crit_, representing a very effective hit. These tend to deal a great deal of damage and almost always inflict Status. 
* **Damage** shows how much damage is dealt by the attack. This is present for all Strikes and some Maneuvers.
* **Status** shows what status conditions this attack may afflict. These will always follow the format Condition X (Y Block). The Condition is the actual status effect being afflicted, such as Hobbled. X is present if this Technique afflicts a Condition, and designates the size of the Token. Sometimes this will be followed by a x2 or x3, indicating that it applies multiple Tokens of that size. Finally, the Y Block section designates what must be paid to Negate this status effect. When this Technique is used, the Target may pay Y of the listed Block to not gain the status effect. Some Techniques will have effects that say +(Defensive Token). In these cases, the attacker gains the Token, not the defender.
