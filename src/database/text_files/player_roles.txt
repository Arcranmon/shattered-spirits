In order to help the game run more smoothly, some responsibilities that might be the GMs in a different TTRPG are relegated to the players to help the game flow better. These roles are independent of what the characters are capable of and, while they are not necessary, players should do their best to assist with keeping the game flowing. Not every role needs to be filled, especially for small parties, but players should feel free to adopt multiple roles.
